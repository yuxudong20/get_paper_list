Sugiura, "Prototypical Contrastive Transfer Learning for Multimodal Language Understanding," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 25-32, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341388.Abstract: Although domestic service robots are expected to assist individuals who require support, they cannot currently interact smoothly with people through natural language. For example, given the instruction “Bring me a bottle from the kitchen,” it is difficult for such robots to specify the bottle in an indoor environment. Most conventional models have been trained on real-world datasets that are labor-intensive to collect, and they have not fully leveraged simulation data through a transfer learning framework. In this study, we propose a novel transfer learning approach for multimodal language understanding called Prototypical Contrastive Transfer Learning (PCTL), which uses a new contrastive loss called Dual ProtoNCE. We introduce PCTL to the task of identifying target objects in domestic environments according to free-form natural language instructions. To validate PCTL, we built new real-world and simulation datasets. Our experiment demonstrated that PCTL outperformed existing methods. Specifically, PCTL achieved an accuracy of 78.1 %, whereas simple fine-tuning achieved an accuracy of 73.4 %. keywords: {Visualization;Service robots;Transfer learning;Natural languages;Data models;Indoor environment;Object recognition},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341388&isnumber=10341342

However, the Softmax output by the last layer of network is often over-confident. We propose a novel confidence estimation method by considering model quality for deep classification models. Two metrics, MQ-Repres and MQ-Discri are developed accordingly to evaluate the model quality, and also provide a new confidence estimation called MQ-Conf for online inference. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed method by the $3D$ semantic segmentation tasks using three different deep networks. Through confusion analysis and feature visualization we show the rationality and reliability of the model quality quantification method.11This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U22A2061 and High-performance Computing Platform of Peking University. keywords: {Measurement;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Computational modeling;Semantic segmentation;High performance computing;Estimation},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341548&isnumber=10341342

Liu, "Self-Supervised Drivable Area Segmentation Using LiDAR's Depth Information for Autonomous Driving," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 41-48, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341687.Abstract: Drivable area segmentation is an essential component of the visual perception system for autonomous driving vehicles. Recent efforts in deep neural networks have sig-nificantly improved semantic segmentation performance for autonomous driving. However, most DNN-based methods need a large amount of data to train the models, and collecting large-scale datasets with manually labeled ground truth is costly, tedious, time consuming and requires the availability of experts, making DNN-based methods often difficult to implement in real world applications. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a novel module named automatic data labeler (ADL), which leverages a deterministic LiDAR-based method for ground plane segmentation and road boundary detection to create large datasets suitable for training DNNs. Furthermore, since the data generated by our ADL module is not as accurate as the manually annotated data, we introduce uncertainty estimation to compensate for the gap between the human labeler and our ADL. Finally, we train the semantic segmentation neural networks using our automatically generated labels on the KITTI dataset [10] and KITTI-CARLA dataset [7]. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ADL method not only achieves impressive performance compared to manual labeling but also exhibits more robust and accurate results than both traditional methods and state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. keywords: {Point cloud compression;Training;Laser radar;Uncertainty;Semantic segmentation;Roads;Training data},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341687&isnumber=10341342

In this paper, we tackle this problem by representing the scene as dynamic occupancy grid maps (DOGMs), associating semantic labels to the occupied cells and incorporating map information. We propose a novel framework that combines deep-learning-based spatio-temporal and probabilistic approaches to predict vehicle behaviors. Contrary to the conventional OGM prediction methods, evaluation of our work is conducted against the ground truth annotations. We experiment and validate our results on real-world NuScenes dataset and show that our model shows superior ability to predict both static and dynamic vehicles compared to OGM predictions. Furthermore, we perform an ablation study and assess the role of semantic labels and map in the architecture. keywords: {Uncertainty;Pedestrians;Semantics;Dynamics;Predictive models;Probabilistic logic;Behavioral sciences;Scene Prediction;Motion Forecasting;Deep Learning;Autonomous Vehicles},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342507&isnumber=10341342

However, there is still no remarkable result on 3D point cloud semantic segmentation compared to those of 2D research. One important reason is that 3D data has higher dimensionality but lacks large datasets, which means that the deep learning model is difficult to optimize and easy to overfit. To overcome this, an essential method is to provide more priors to the learning of deep models. In this paper, we focus on semantic segmentation for point clouds in the real world. To provide priors to the model, we propose a novel loss function called Linearity and Planarity to enhance local feature consistency in the regions with similar local structure. Experiments show that the proposed method improves baseline performance on both indoor and outdoor datasets e.g. S3DIS and Semantic3D. keywords: {Point cloud compression;Semiconductor device modeling;Deep learning;Training;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Semantic segmentation},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342338&isnumber=10341342

H. Son and J. Weiland, "Lightweight Semantic Segmentation Network for Semantic Scene Understanding on Low-Compute Devices," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 62-69, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342110.Abstract: Semantic scene understanding is beneficial for mobile robots. Semantic information obtained through onboard cameras can improve robots' navigation performance. However, obtaining semantic information on small mobile robots with constrained power and computation resources is challenging. We propose a new lightweight convolution neural network comparable to previous semantic segmentation algorithms for mobile applications. Our network achieved 73.06% on the Cityscapes validation set and 71.8% on the Cityscapes test set. Our model runs at 116 fps with $\mathbf{1024\mathrm{x}2048}$, 172 fps with $1024\mathrm{x}1024$, and 175 fps with $720\mathrm{x}960$ on NVIDIA GTX 1080. We analyze a model size, which is defined as the summation of the number of floating operations and the number of parameters. The smaller model size enables tiny mobile robot systems that should operate multiple tasks simultaneously to work efficiently. Our model has the smallest model size compared to the real-time semantic segmentation convolution neural networks ranked on Cityscapes real-time benchmark and other high performing, lightweight convolution neural networks. On the Camvid test set, our model achieved a mIoU of 73.29% with Cityscapes pre-training, which outperformed the accuracy of other lightweight convolution neural networks. For mobile applicability, we measured frame-per-second on different low-compute devices. Our model operates 35 fps on Jetson Xavier AGX, 21 FPS on Jetson Xavier NX, and 14 FPS on a ROS ASUS gaming phone. $1024\mathrm{x}2048$ resolution is used for the Jetson devices, and $512\mathrm{x}512$ size is utilized for the measurement on the phone. Our network did not use extra datasets such as ImageNet, Coarse Cityscapes, and Mapillary. Additionally, we did not use TensorRT to achieve fast inference speed. Compared to other real-time and lightweight CNNs, our model achieved significantly more efficiency while balancing accuracy, inference speed, and model size. keywords: {Performance evaluation;Convolution;Semantic segmentation;Semantics;Neural networks;Robot vision systems;Size measurement},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342110&isnumber=10341342

We first transform the range image and semantic features of the past scan into the range view of current scan based on the relative pose between scans. The residual image is obtained by calculating the normalized absolute difference between the current and transformed range images. Then, we apply a Meta-Kernel based cross scan fusion (CSF) module to adaptively fuse the range images and semantic features of current scan, the residual image and transformed features. Finally, the fused features with rich motion and semantic information are processed to obtain reliable MOS results. We also introduce a residual image augmentation method to further improve the MOS performance. Our method outperforms most LiDAR-MOS methods with only two sequential LiDAR scans as inputs on the SemanticKITTI MOS dataset. keywords: {Training;Laser radar;Three-dimensional displays;Semantic segmentation;Semantics;Object segmentation;Transforms},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341426&isnumber=10341342

Montijano, "Robust Fusion for Bayesian Semantic Mapping," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 76-81, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342253.Abstract: The integration of semantic information in a map allows robots to understand better their environment and make high-level decisions. In the last few years, neural networks have shown enormous progress in their perception capabilities. However, when fusing multiple observations from a neural network in a semantic map, its inherent overconfidence with unknown data gives too much weight to the outliers and decreases the robustness. To mitigate this issue we propose a novel robust fusion method to combine multiple Bayesian semantic predictions. Our method uses the uncertainty estimation provided by a Bayesian neural network to calibrate the way in which the measurements are fused. This is done by regularizing the observations to mitigate the problem of overconfident outlier predictions and using the epistemic uncertainty to weigh their influence in the fusion, resulting in a different formulation of the probability distributions. We validate our robust fusion strategy by performing experiments on photo-realistic simulated environments and real scenes. In both cases, we use a network trained on different data to expose the model to varying data distributions. The results show that considering the model's uncertainty and regularizing the probability distribution of the observations distribution results in a better semantic segmentation performance and more robustness to outliers, compared with other methods.

Prior work on object rearrangement has explored a diverse set of techniques for following user instructions to achieve some desired goal state. Logical predicates, images of the goal scene, and natural language descriptions have all been used to instruct a robot in how to arrange objects. In this work, we argue that burdening the user with specifying goal scenes is not necessary in partially-arranged environments, such as common household settings. Instead, we show that contextual cues from partially arranged scenes (i.e., the placement of some number of pre-arranged objects in the environment) provide sufficient context to enable robots to perform object rearrangement without any explicit user goal specification. We introduce ConSOR, a Context-aware Semantic Object Rearrangement framework that utilizes contextual cues from a partially arranged initial state of the environment to complete the arrangement of new objects, without explicit goal specification from the user. We demonstrate that ConSOR strongly outperforms two baselines in generalizing to novel object arrangements and unseen object categories.

Liu, "IDA: Informed Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 90-97, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342254.Abstract: Mixup-based data augmentation has been validated to be a critical stage in the self-training framework for unsupervised domain adaptive semantic segmentation (UDASS), which aims to transfer knowledge from a well-annotated (source) domain to an unlabeled (target) domain. Existing self-training methods usually adopt the popular region-based mixup techniques with a random sampling strategy, which unfortunately ignores the dynamic evolution of different semantics across various domains as training proceeds. To improve the UDA-SS performance, we propose an Informed Domain Adaptation (IDA) model, a self-training framework that mixes the data based on class-level segmentation performance, which aims to emphasize small-region semantics during mixup. In our IDA model, the class-level performance is tracked by an expected confidence score (ECS). We then use a dynamic schedule to determine the mixing ratio for data in different domains. Extensive experimental results reveal that our proposed method is able to outperform the state-of-the-art UDA-SS method by a margin of 1.1 mIoU in the adaptation of GTA-V to Cityscapes and of 0.9 mIoU in the adaptation of SYNTHIA to Cityscapes.

Many elderly people lack the coordination and strength necessary to perform activities of daily living, such as getting out of bed or stepping into a bathtub. A traditional solution is to install grab bars around the home. For assisting in bathtub transitions, grab bars are fixed to a bathroom wall. However, they are often too far to reach and stably support the user; the installation locations of grab bars are constrained by the room layout and are often suboptimal. In this paper, we present a mobile robot that provides an older adult with a handlebar located anywhere in space - “Handle Anywhere”. The robot consists of an omnidirectional mobile base attached to a reposition able handlebar. We further develop a methodology to optimally place the handle to provide the maximum support for the elderly user while performing common postural changes. A cost function with a trade-off between mechanical advantage and manipulability of the user's arm was optimized in terms of the location of the handlebar relative to the user. The methodology requires only a sagittal plane video of the elderly user performing the postural change, and thus is rapid, scalable, and uniquely customizable to each user. A proof-of-concept prototype was built, and the optimization algorithm for handle location was validated experimentally. keywords: {Protocols;Robot kinematics;Sociology;Prototypes;Muscles;Mobile robots;Older adults},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341348&isnumber=10341342

X. Bao, A. R. Friederich, R. J. Triolo and M. L. Audu, "A Hybrid FNS Generator for Human Trunk Posture Control with Incomplete Knowledge of Neuromusculoskeletal Dynamics," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 130-136, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342462.Abstract: The trunk movements of an individual paralyzed by spinal cord injury (SCI) can be restored by Functional Neuromuscular Stimulation (FNS), a technique that applies low-level current to motor nerves to activate the muscles generating torques, and thus, produce trunk motions. FNS can be modulated to control trunk movements. However, a stabilizing modulation policy (i.e., control law) is difficult to derive due to the complexity of neuromusculoskeletal dynamics, which consist of skeletal dynamics (i.e., multi-joint rigid body dynamics) and neuromuscular dynamics (i.e., a highly nonlinear, non-autonomous, and input redundant dynamics). Therefore, an FNS-based control method that can stabilize the trunk without knowing the accurate skeletal and neuromuscular dynamics is desired. This work proposed an FNS generator, which consists of a robust nonlinear controller (RNC) that provides stabilizing torque command and an artificial neural network (ANN)-based torque-to-activation (T-A) map to ensure that the muscle generates the stabilizing torque to the skeleton. Due to the robustness and learning capability of this control framework, full knowledge of the trunk neuromusculoskeletal dynamics is not required. The proposed control framework has been tested in a simulation environment where an anatomically realistic 3D musculoskeletal model of the human trunk was manipulated to follow a time-varying reference that moves in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. From the results, it can be seen that the trunk motion converges to a satisfactory trajectory while the ANN is being updated. The results suggest the potential of this control framework for trunk tracking tasks in a clinical application. keywords: {Torque;Three-dimensional displays;Neuromuscular;Tracking;Dynamics;Artificial neural networks;Generators},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342462&isnumber=10341342

Walking is an important element in extending healthy life expectancy in old age. In particular, induction of proper ankle joint alignment at heel contact is important during the gait cycle from the perspective of smooth weight transfer and reduction of burden on the knees and hip. In this study, we focus on the behavior of the ankle joint at heel contact and propose an insole-type assist device that can induce the ankle angle inversion/eversion rotation. The proposed device has tilting of the heel part from left to right in response to the rotation of a stepping motor, and an inertial sensor mounted inside controls the heel part to always maintain a horizontal position. The effectiveness of the proposed device is verified by evaluating the amount of lateral thrust of the knee joint of six healthy male subjects during a foot-stepping motion using motion capture system. The results showed that the amount of lateral thrust is significantly reduced by wearing the device with control. keywords: {Legged locomotion;Knee;Pistons;Induction motors;Inertial sensors;Scholarships;Motion capture},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342205&isnumber=10341342

A majority of studies on the assistive devices have focused on the assisting torque in the sagittal plane. In the case of running, however, the abduction torque in the frontal plane at the hip joint is greater than the flexion/extension torque in the sagittal plane. During running, as does an elastic body, the abduction torque and the motion of the hip joint have a linear relationship, but are opposite in direction. It is expected that the hip abduction torque can be assisted with a simple passive method by using an elastic body that reflects the movement characteristics of the hip joint. In this study, therefore, a system to assist hip abduction torque using a leaf spring was proposed with a prototype testing. While running with the assist system proposed, the leaf spring aids the abduction torque on the stance phase, and the torque is not generated due to the passive revolute joint on the swing phase. The joint angle is changed with respective to the rotation in the flexion/extension direction to prevent discomfort torque during swing phase and to increase the duration of the torque action during stance phase. A preliminary test was conducted on one subject using the prototype of the hip joint abduction torque assistive device. The participant with the assistive device reduced metabolic energy by 5% compared to the case without abduction torque assist while running at 2.5m/s. In order to increase the amount of metabolic reduction, the device shall be supplemented by system mass reduction and hip joint position optimization. keywords: {Torque;Government;Prototypes;Assistive devices;Springs;Hip;Optimization},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341611&isnumber=10341342

One form of wearable technology is wear-able sensors for kinematic measurements of human motion. However, measuring the kinematics of human movement is a challenging problem as wearable sensors need to conform to complex curvatures and deform without limiting the user's natural range of motion. In fine motor activities, such challenges are further exacerbated by the dense packing of several joints, coupled joint motions, and relatively small deformations. This work presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of a thin, breathable sensing glove capable of reconstructing fine motor kinematics. The fabric glove features capacitive sensors made from layers of conductive and dielectric fabrics, culminating in a non-bulky and discrete glove design. This study demonstrates that the glove can reconstruct the joint angles of the wearer with a root mean square error of 7.2 degrees, indicating promising applicability to dynamic pose reconstruction for wearable technology and robot teleoperation. keywords: {Thumb;Kinematics;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Robot sensing systems;Fabrics;Capacitive sensors;Root mean square},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342129&isnumber=10341342

To address this need, we have developed a neurorehabilitation platform by integrating a wearable robotic hip abduction-adduction exoskeleton with a visual interface. The platform is expected to influence and rehabilitate the underlying visuomotor mechanisms in individuals by having users perform motion tasks based on visual feedback while the robot applies various controlled resistances governed by the admittance controller implemented in the robot. A preliminary study was performed on 3 non disabled individuals to analyze the performance of the system and observe any adaptation in hip joint kinematics and kinetics as a result of the visuomotor training under 4 different admittance conditions. All three subjects exhibited increased consistency of motion during training and interlimb coordination to achieve motion tasks, demonstrating the utility of the system. Further analysis of observed human-robot torque interactions and electromyography (EMG) signals, and its implication in neurorehabilitation aimed at populations suffering from chronic stroke are discussed. keywords: {Training;Visualization;Robot kinematics;Sociology;Neurorehabilitation;Electromyography;Admittance},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341735&isnumber=10341342

For the appropriate function of the wearable robot, the pressure between the strap and the skin should be maintained appropriately. Due to muscle contraction, the cross-section area of the human limb changes according to the movement of the muscle. The cross-section area change causes the change in the pressure applied by the strap. Therefore, for a new strap design to resolve this, it is necessary to understand the shape change characteristics of the muscle where the strap is applied. In this paper, the change in the circumference of the thigh and the calf during walking was measured and analyzed by multiple string pot sensors. With a treadmill and string pot sensors using potentiometers, torsion springs, and leg circumference changes were measured for different walking speeds and slopes. And, gait cycles were divided according to a signal from the FSR sensor inserted in the right shoe. From the experimental results, there were changes in the circumference of about 8.5mm and 3mm for the thigh and the calf, respectively. And we found tendencies in various walking circumstances such as walking speed and degree of the slope.

Yip, "Finding Biomechanically Safe Trajectories for Robot Manipulation of the Human Body in a Search and Rescue Scenario," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 167-173, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342353.Abstract: There has been increasing awareness of the difficulties in reaching and extracting people from mass casualty scenarios, such as those arising from natural disasters. While platforms have been designed to consider reaching casualties and even carrying them out of harm's way, the challenge of repositioning a casualty from its found configuration to one suitable for extraction has not been explicitly explored. Furthermore, this planning problem needs to incorporate biomechanical safety considerations for the casualty. Thus, we present a first solution to biomechanically safe trajectory generation for repositioning limbs of unconscious human casualties. We describe biomechanical safety as mathematical constraints, mechanical descriptions of the dynamics for the robot-human coupled system, and the planning and trajectory optimization process that considers this coupled and constrained system. We finally evaluate our approach over several variations of the problem and demonstrate it on a real robot and human subject. This work provides a crucial part of search and rescue that can be used in conjunction with past and present works involving robots and vision systems designed for search and rescue. keywords: {Biomechanics;Terrorism;Machine vision;Human factors;Threat assessment;Explosions;Safety},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342353&isnumber=10341342

While often the environment is assumed to be static, real-world settings, such as assembly lines, contain complex shaped, moving obstacles and changing target states. Therein robots must perform safe and efficient motions to achieve their tasks. In repetitive environments and multi-goal settings, reusable roadmaps can substantially reduce the overall query time. Most dynamic roadmap-based planners operate in state-time-space, which is computationally demanding. Interval-based methods store availabilities as node attributes and thereby circumvent the dimensionality increase. However, current approaches do not consider higher-order constraints, which can ultimately lead to collisions during execution. Furthermore, current approaches must replan when the goal changes. To this end, we propose a novel roadmap-based planner for systems with third-order differential constraints operating in dynamic environments with moving goals. We construct a roadmap with availabilities as node attributes. During the query phase, we use a Double-Integrator Minimum Time (DIMT) solver to recursively build feasible trajectories and accurately estimate arrival times. An exit node set in combination with a moving goal heuristic is used to efficiently find the fastest path through the roadmap to the moving goal. We evaluate our method with a simulated UAV operating in dynamic 2D environments and show that it also transfers to a 6-DoF manipulator. We show higher success rates than other state-of-the-art methods both in collision avoidance and reaching a moving goal. keywords: {Dynamics;Autonomous aerial vehicles;6-DOF;Planning;Trajectory;Task analysis;Complex systems},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341670&isnumber=10341342

In this system, the human is responsible for making high-level steering decisions, and the robot, in turn, provides haptic feedback for collision avoidance and path suggestions while reacting to changes in the environment. Our algorithm uses optimized Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT*) to generate paths to lead the user to the goal, via an attractive force feedback computed using a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF). We simultaneously ensure collision avoidance where necessary using a Control Barrier Function (CBF). We demonstrate our approach using simulations with a virtual pilot, and hardware experiments with a human pilot. Our results show that combining RRT* and CBFs is a promising tool for enabling collaborative human-robot navigation. keywords: {Navigation;Heuristic algorithms;Computational modeling;Force feedback;Dynamics;Hardware;Collision avoidance},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342042&isnumber=10341342

To achieve this, we developed a high-level decision-making algorithm that generates short-term navigational goals for the mobile robot. Monte Carlo Tree Search is integrated with a Deep Reinforcement Learning method to enhance the performance of the decision-making process and generate more reliable navigational goals.

The robot may perform poorly and cause hindrances if it does not reason over possible, multi-modal future social interactions. With the goal of enhancing autonomous navigation in cluttered environments, we propose a novel formulation for nonlinear model predictive control including multi-modal predictions of human motion. As a result, our approach leads to less conservative, smooth and intuitive human-aware navigation with reduced risk of collisions, and shows a good balance between task efficiency, collision avoidance and human comfort. To show its effectiveness, we compare our approach against the state of the art in crowded simulated environments, and with real-world human motion data from the THOR dataset. This comparison shows that we are able to improve task efficiency, keep a larger distance to humans and significantly reduce the collision time, when navigating in cluttered dynamic environ-ments. Furthermore, the method is shown to work robustly with different state-of-the-art human motion predictors. keywords: {Navigation;Trajectory planning;Robot kinematics;Dynamics;Stochastic processes;Prediction methods;Reliability},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341702&isnumber=10341342

Pan, "A Novel Obstacle-Avoidance Solution With Non-Iterative Neural Controller for Joint-Constrained Redundant Manipulators," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 237-243, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342293.Abstract: Obstacle avoidance (OA) and joint-limit avoidance (JLA) are essential for redundant manipulators to ensure safe and reliable robotic operations. One solution to OA and JLA is to incorporate the involved constraints into a quadratic programming (QP), by solving which OA and JLA can be achieved. There exist a few non-iterative solvers such as zeroing neural networks (ZNNs), which can solve each sampled QP problem using only one iteration, yet no solution is suitable for OA and JLA due to the absence of some derivative information. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel solution with a non-iterative neural controller termed NCP-ZNN for joint-constrained redundant manipulators. Unlike iterative methods, the neural controller involving derivative information proposed in this paper possesses some positive features including non-iterative computing and convergence with time. In this paper, the reestablished OA-JLA scheme is first introduced. Then, the design details of the neural controller are presented. After that, some comparative simulations based on a PA10 robot and an experiment based on a Franka Emika Panda robot are conducted, demonstrating that the proposed neural controller is more competent in OA and JLA. keywords: {Computational modeling;Neural networks;Manipulators;Mathematical models;Iterative methods;Reliability;Quadratic programming},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342293&isnumber=10341342

Most existing methods rely on object detection algorithms, which only predict predefined collision targets, such as vehicles and pedestrians, and cannot anticipate emergencies caused by unknown obstacles. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach using pixel-wise time-to-collision (TTC) estimation for monocular collision prediction (TTC4MCP). Our approach predicts TTC and optical flow from monocular images and identifies potential collision areas using feature clustering and motion analysis. To overcome the challenge of training TTC estimation models without ground truth data in new scenes, we propose a self-supervised TTC training method, enabling collision prediction in a wider range of scenarios. TTC4MCP is evaluated on multiple road conditions and demonstrates promising results in terms of accuracy and robustness. keywords: {Training;Roads;Estimation;Self-supervised learning;Object detection;Predictive models;Robustness},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341966&isnumber=10341342

This versatile and reusable approach is applicable to various collaboration scenarios. The primary advantage of DAMON is its ability to embed information in a low-dimensional graph, eliminating the need for repeated computation required by current sampling-based methods. As a result, it offers faster and more efficient motion planning with significantly lower computational overhead and memory footprint. In summary, DAMON is a breakthrough methodology that addresses the challenge of dynamic obstacle avoidance in robotic systems and offers a promising solution for safe and efficient human-robot collaboration. Our approach has been experimentally validated on a 7-DoF robotic manipulator in both simulation and physical settings. DAMON enables the robot to learn and generate skills for avoiding previously-unseen obstacles while achieving predefined objectives. We also optimize DAMON's design parameters and performance using an analytical framework. Our approach outperforms mainstream methodologies, including RRT, RRT*, Dynamic RRT*, L2RRT, and MpNet, with 40% more trajectory smoothness and over 65% improved latency performance, on average. keywords: {Three-dimensional displays;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamics;Collaboration;Manifold learning;Trajectory;Planning},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342035&isnumber=10341342

Our key contribution is that (A) we propose an algorithm to recursively construct committed trajectories, and (B) we prove that tracking the committed trajectory ensures the system is safe for all time into the future.

Constraints of this form are often formulated as mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems employing big-M techniques-however, these are generally not the strongest formulations possible with respect to the MIP's convex relaxation (so called ideal formulations), potentially resulting in larger computational burden. We instead model obstacle avoidance as combinatorial disjunctive constraints and leverage the independent branching scheme to construct small, ideal formulations. As our approach requires a biclique cover for an associated graph, we exploit the structure of this class of graphs to develop a fast subroutine for obtaining biclique covers in polynomial time. We also contribute an open-source Julia library named ClutteredEnvPathOpt to facilitate computational experiments of MIP formulations for obstacle avoidance. Experiments have shown our formulation is more compact and remains competitive on a number of instances compared with standard big-M techniques, for which solvers possess highly optimized procedures. keywords: {Algorithms;Computational modeling;Programming;Path planning;Libraries;Collision avoidance;Optimization},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342117&isnumber=10341342

By optimizing the intersection of the reachable set and iterative non-safe region generated by the control barrier function, the system demonstrates better performance in terms of safety with a constant decay rate, while enhancing the feasibility of the optimization problem. The proposed algorithm improves real-time performance due to a shorter horizon and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in the simulation environment and on a real robot. keywords: {Prediction algorithms;Linear programming;Real-time systems;Safety;Iterative methods;Collision avoidance;Reachability analysis},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341919&isnumber=10341342

However, existing work either oversimplifies the robot's geometry and environment representation, resulting in a conservative trajectory or suffers from a huge overhead in maintaining additional information such as the Signed Distance Field (SDF). To bridge the gap, we consider the robot as an implicit function, with its surface boundary represented by the zero-level set of its SDF. We further employ another implicit function to lazily compute the signed distance to the swept volume generated by the robot and its trajectory. The computation is efficient by exploiting continuity in space-time, and the implicit function guarantees continuous collision evaluation even for nonconvex robots with complex surfaces. We also propose a trajectory optimization pipeline applicable to the implicit SDF. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the high performance of our approach for arbitrarily shaped robot trajectory optimization. keywords: {Geometry;Pipelines;Planning;Computational efficiency;Collision avoidance;Robots;Trajectory optimization},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342104&isnumber=10341342

Most existing works either opt for the conservative corridor-based methods that impose strict requirements on the corridor generation, or ESDF-based methods that suffer from high computational overhead. It is still a great challenge to achieve fast and accurate whole-body collision evaluation. In this paper, we propose a Robo-centric ESDF (RC-ESDF) that is pre-built in the robot body frame and is capable of seamlessly applied to any-shape mobile robots, even for those with non-convex shapes. RC-ESDF enjoys lazy collision evaluation, which retains only the minimum information sufficient for whole-body safety constraint and significantly speeds up trajectory optimization. Based on the analytical gradients provided by RC-ESDF, we optimize the position and rotation of robot jointly, with whole-body safety, smoothness, and dynamical feasibility taken into account. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments verified the reliability and generalizability of our method. keywords: {Shape;Trajectory planning;Real-time systems;Safety;Planning;Mobile robots;Reliability},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342074&isnumber=10341342

The issue arises because most of these algorithms are agent-level methods. They concentrate solely on preventing collisions between the agents while the obstacles are handled merely out-of-policy. Obstacle-aware policies output an action considering both agents and obstacles. Current obstacle-aware algorithms, mainly based on Lidar sensor data, struggle to handle collision avoidance around complex obstacles. To resolve this issue, this paper investigates how to find a better way to travel around diverse obstacles. In particular, we present a global map assisted collision avoidance algorithm which, following the lead of a high-level goal guide and using an obstacle representation called distance map, considers other agents and obstacles simultaneously. Moreover, our model can be loaded into each agent individually, making it applicable to large maps or more agents. Simulation results indicate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, showing in scenarios with complex obstacles. We present a notion for incorporating global information in decentralized decision-making, along with a method for extending agent-level algorithms to cluttered environments in real-world scenarios. keywords: {Deep learning;Laser radar;Shape;Navigation;Simulation;Decision making;Reinforcement learning},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341762&isnumber=10341342

Each robotic module is equipped with a steerable omni-wheel for navigation and is shaped as a regular icositetragon with a permanent magnet installed on each corner for stable docking. After aggregating multiple modules and forming a structure that can cage a target object, we have developed an optimization-based method to compute the distribution of all wheels' heading directions, which enables efficient omnidirectional movements of the structure. By implementing a hierarchical controller on our prototyped system in both simulation and experiment, we validated the trajectory tracking performance of an individual module and a team of six modules in multiple navigation and collaborative object transportation settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed system can maintain a stable caging formation and achieve smooth transportation, indicating the effectiveness of our hardware and locomotion designs. keywords: {Navigation;Trajectory tracking;Scalability;Warehousing;Transportation;Collaboration;Wheels},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341772&isnumber=10341342

The study reveals that spinal flexion can enhance limb stride length, but it may also cause significant and unexpected motion disturbances during stride length variations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a CPG model driven by spinal flexion and a novel oscillator that incorporates a circular limit cycle and accounts for the anticipated stride length transition process. This approach effectively matches the torque change with the dynamics of stride length changes, leading to lower energy consumption. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed oscillator and compare it with the original kinetic model and other CPG models. The results demonstrate that the designed CPG model with the proposed oscillator yields smoother gait transitions during stride length variations and reduces energy consumption. keywords: {Legged locomotion;Adaptation models;Energy consumption;Robot kinematics;Spine;Limit-cycles;Generators},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341791&isnumber=10341342

In order to further improve the estimation accuracy while running the system, we propose to adapt the noise information in this paper. This would automatically reduce the system vulnerability to imperfect modelings and sensor changes. Moreover, viable strategies to maintain the system stability are introduced.

The sensor measurement is converted to a scalar value (the score) through some mapping (the score function); the latter may be designed or learned. The score is then mapped to forward and angular velocities using a simple rule with three parameters. The key contribution is that the correctness of this controller only relies on the score function satisfying monotonicity conditions with respect to the underlying state - local path coordinates - instead of achieving specific values at all states. The monotonicity conditions may be checked online by moving the WMR, without state estimation, or offline using a generative model of measurements such as in a simulator. Our approach provides both the practicality of a purely measurement-based control and the correctness of state-based guarantees. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this path-following approach on both a simulated and a physical WMR that use a learned score function derived from a binary classifier trained on real depth images. keywords: {Robot kinematics;Kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Angular velocity;Mobile robots;State estimation;Intelligent robots},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342233&isnumber=10341342

The main challenge of sim-to-real RL is to overcome the reality gap - the discrepancies between the real world and its simulated counterpart. Using generic geometric representations, such as convex decomposition, triangular mesh, signed distance field can improve simulation fidelity, and thus potentially narrow the reality gap. Common to these approaches is that many contact points are generated for geometrically-complex objects, which slows down simulation and may cause numerical instability. Contact reduction methods address these issues by limiting the number of contact points, but the validity of these methods for sim-to-real RL has not been confirmed. In this paper, we present a contact reduction method with bounded stiffness to improve the simulation accuracy. Our experiments show that the proposed method critically enables training RL policy for a tight-clearance double pin insertion task and successfully deploying the policy on a rigid, position-controlled physical robot. keywords: {Training;Limiting;Reinforcement learning;Pins;Task analysis;Intelligent robots},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341866&isnumber=10341342

Primary progress in robotics inspired by these natural systems has occurred in two areas: highly theoretical computational neuroscience models, and handcrafted systems like RatSLAM and NeuroSLAM. In this research, we present work bridging the gap between the two, in the form of Multiscale Continuous Attractor Networks (MCAN), that combine the multiscale parallel spatial neural networks of the previous theoretical models with the real-world robustness of the robot-targeted systems, to enable trajectory tracking over large velocity ranges. To overcome the limitations of the reliance of previous systems on hand-tuned parameters, we present a genetic algorithm-based approach for automated tuning of these networks, substantially improving their usability. To provide challenging navigational scale ranges, we open source a flexible city-scale navigation simulator that adapts to any street network, enabling high throughput experimentation11https://github.com/theresejoseph/Trajectory_ Tracking_via_MCAN/ • In extensive experiments using the city-scale navigation environment and Kitti, we show that the system is capable of stable dead reckoning over a wide range of velocities and environmental scales, where a single-scale approach fails. keywords: {Dead reckoning;Trajectory tracking;Computational modeling;Insects;Throughput;Robustness;Usability},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341938&isnumber=10341342

Two hardware platforms and analytical models were developed to test design and control methodologies. The full-scale ballbot prototype (MiaPURE) was constructed using off-the-shelf components and designed to have agility, footprint, and balance similar to that of a walking human. The planar inverted pendulum testbed (PIPTB) was developed as a reduced-order testbed for quick validation of system performance. We then proposed a simple yet robust cascaded LQR-PI controller to balance and maneuver the ballbot drivetrain with a heavy payload. This is crucial because the drivetrain is often subject to high stiction due to elastomeric components in the torque transmission system. This controller was first tested in the PIPTB to compare with traditional LQR and cascaded PI-PD controllers, and then implemented in the ballbot drivetrain. The MiaPURE drivetrain was able to carry a payload of 60 kg, achieve a maximum speed of 2.3 m/s, and come to a stop from a speed of 1.4 m/s in 2 seconds in a selected translation direction. Finally, we demonstrated the omnidirectional movement of the ballbot drivetrain in an indoor environment as a payload-carrying robot and a human-riding mobility device. Our experiments demonstrated the feasibility of using the ballbot drivetrain as a universal mobility platform with agile movements, minimal footprint, and high payload capacity using our proposed design and control methodologies. keywords: {Torso;Torque;Friction;System performance;Prototypes;Control systems;Stability analysis;Body Balancing;Wheeled Robots;Underactuated Robots},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342007&isnumber=10341342

Drawing on cognition theory, the proposed approach achieves effective convergence with fewer training episodes. The coach-based demonstration phase narrows the search space and establishes a foundation for a coarse-to-fine control strategy. The reconnaissance phase enhances adaptability by discovering a valuable global repre-sentation, and the operation phase produces accurate robotic control by applying the learned representation and periodically updating local information. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods validates the efficacy of our approach on exemplar control tasks in simulation and a biomedical project involving a simulated cranial window task. keywords: {Training;Uncertainty;Robot control;Reinforcement learning;Reconnaissance;Bayes methods;Cranial},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342166&isnumber=10341342

However, their unique and sensitive dynamics impose challenges to obtaining robust control policies in the real world. In this work, we demonstrate robust sim-to-real transfer of control policies on the BALLU robots via system identification and our novel residual physics learning method, Environment Mimic (EnvMimic). First, we model the nonlinear dynamics of the actuators by collecting hardware data and optimizing the simulation parameters. Rather than relying on standard supervised learning formulations, we utilize deep reinforcement learning to train an external force policy to match real-world trajectories, which enables us to model residual physics with greater fidelity. We analyze the improved simulation fidelity by comparing the simulation trajectories against the real-world ones. We finally demonstrate that the improved simulator allows us to learn better walking and turning policies that can be successfully deployed on the hardware of BALLU. keywords: {Legged locomotion;Supervised learning;Buoyancy;Robot sensing systems;Turning;Hardware;Trajectory},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342062&isnumber=10341342

Compared to monolithic manipulators, they promise greater flexibility, improved maintainability, and cost-efficiency. However, there is no tool or standardized way to model and simulate assemblies of modules in the same way it has been done for robotic manipulators for decades. We introduce the Toolbox for Industrial Modular Robotics (Timor), a Python toolbox to bridge this gap and integrate modular robotics into existing simulation and optimization pipelines. Our open-source library offers model generation and task-based configuration optimization for MRRs. It can easily be integrated with existing simulation tools - not least by offering URDF export of arbitrary modular robot assemblies. Moreover, our experimental study demonstrates the effectiveness of Timor as a tool for designing modular robots optimized for specific use cases. keywords: {Service robots;Source coding;Pipelines;Tutorials;Manipulators;Libraries;Task analysis},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341935&isnumber=10341342

When learning in contact with the environment, one must consider how to minimize the impact on the environment and maintain reproducibility. To achieve this, the contact force with the environment must be reduced. One way to achieve this is to reduce the inertia of the arm. In this study, we present an arm we have developed with 6 degrees of freedom and low inertia. The inertia of our arm has been significantly reduced compared to previous research, and experiments have confirmed that it also has low joint friction torque and good contact sensitivity. keywords: {Wrist;Torque;Sensitivity;Friction;Robot sensing systems;Manipulators;6-DOF},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342445&isnumber=10341342

The characteristics of the drive system and thus also of the robot depend strongly on the gears. Different gearbox designs are available which differ in stiffness, efficiency and further properties. For an application-optimal design of RLS a uniform documentation and a comparability of gearbox concepts is a decisive factor. The application-optimal design is supported by an interdisciplinary approach between mechanical engineering and software design, guided by adequate product development methodology. The quite heterogeneous characterization of gearboxes for RLS which is currently the state of the art is a relevant obstacle in the flexible and optimal design of RLS. The paper shows the analysis of the gear structure with unified symbols for specific machine elements and contact types. The introduced method gives insight into the mechanical structure of the gearboxes. Similarities between gear types can thus be revealed. This also enables the classification of new developments in the state of the art. Moreover, the developed method for analyzing the gear structure can be used to determine the characteristics of gears. Examples for these characteristics are backlash, efficiency or stiffness. Specifically, the stiffness of gears can be synthesized by the force action of individual contacts and the individual phenomena that occur with them. The representation by individual phenomena also makes it possible to extend the calculation to include influencing parameters such as temperature that have not been sufficiently taken into account so far. keywords: {Temperature;Software design;Gears;Force;Symbols;Documentation;Product development},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342105&isnumber=10341342

Jamming is a mechanical phenomenon with which dramatic changes in stiffness can be achieved by increasing the frictional and kinematic coupling between constituents in a structure by applying an external pressure. This study applies jamming, which has been primarily used in medium-scale soft robotics applications to large-scale deployable structures with components that are soft and compact during transport, but rigid upon deployment. It proposes a new jamming structure with a novel built-in actuation mechanism which enables high-performance at large scales: a composite beam made of rectangular segments along a cable which can be pre-tensioned and thus jammed. Two theoretical models are developed to provide insights into the mechanical behavior of the composite beams and predict their performance under loading. A scale model of a deployable bridge is built using the tension-based composite beams, and the bridge is deployed and assembled by air with a drone demonstrating the versatility and viability of the proposed approach for robotics applications. keywords: {Bridges;Atmospheric modeling;Loading;Kinematics;Soft robotics;Predictive models;Behavioral sciences;Mechanism Design;Compliant Joints and Mechanisms;Soft Robot Materials and Design},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342131&isnumber=10341342

Cai et al., "Task2Morph: Differentiable Task-Inspired Framework for Contact-Aware Robot Design," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 452-459, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341360.Abstract: Optimizing the morphologies and the controllers that adapt to various tasks is a critical issue in the field of robot design, aka. embodied intelligence. Previous works typically model it as a joint optimization problem and use search-based methods to find the optimal solution in the morphology space. However, they ignore the implicit knowledge of task-to-morphology mapping which can directly inspire robot design. For example, flipping heavier boxes tends to require more muscular robot arms. This paper proposes a novel and general differentiable task-inspired framework for contact-aware robot design called Task2Morph. We abstract task features highly related to task performance and use them to build a task-to-morphology mapping. Further, we embed the mapping into a differentiable robot design process, where the gradient information is leveraged for both the mapping learning and the whole optimization. The experiments are conducted on three scenarios, and the results validate that Task2Morph outperforms DiffHand, which lacks a task-inspired morphology module, in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. keywords: {Adaptation models;Morphology;Optimization methods;Aerospace electronics;Search problems;Manipulators;Task analysis},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341360&isnumber=10341342

Napp, "Constraint Programming for Component-Level Robot Design," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 460-466, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341679.Abstract: Effective design automation for building robots would make development faster and easier while also less prone to design errors. However, complex multi-domain constraints make creating such tools difficult. One persistent challenge in achieving this goal of design automation is the fundamental problem of component selection, an optimization problem where, given a general robot model, components must be selected from a possibly large set of catalogs to minimize design objectives while meeting target specifications. Different approaches to this problem have used Monotone Co-Design Problems (MCDPs) or linear and quadratic programming, but these require judicious system approximations that affect the accuracy of the solution. We take an alternative approach formulating the component selection problem as a combinatorial optimization problem, which does not require any system approximations, and using constraint programming (CP) to solve this problem with a depth-first branch-and-bound algorithm. As the efficacy of CP critically depends upon the orderings of variables and their domain values, we present two heuristics specific to the problem of component selection that significantly improve solve time compared to traditional constraint satisfaction programming heuristics. We also add redundant constraints to the optimization problem to further improve run time by evaluating certain global constraints before all relevant variables are assigned. We demonstrate that our CP approach can find optimal solutions from over 20 trillion candidate solutions in only seconds, up to 48 times faster than an MCDP approach solving the same problem. Finally, for three different robot designs we build the corresponding robots to physically validate that the selected components meet the target design specifications. keywords: {Constraint handling;Design automation;Computational modeling;Morphology;Programming;Approximation algorithms;Quadratic programming},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341679&isnumber=10341342

Actuation redundancy eliminates all forward-kinematic singularities and improves the motion-force transmission property. Thanks to the special structure of the kinematic chains, all actuators are close to the base and full gravity compensation is achieved passively by using springs. Force producibility analysis shows that this haptic device is able to produce long-term continuous force feedback of 15–30 N in each direction. By developing a prototype of the haptic device and a virtual three-dimensional simulator, a preliminary performance evaluation of the haptic device was conducted. In addition, a torque distribution algorithm considering a relaxed form of actuator-torque saturation was experimentally evaluated, and a comparison with other algorithms reveals that this algorithm offers several advantages. keywords: {Performance evaluation;Actuators;Torque;Redundancy;Force feedback;Prototypes;Kinematics},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342273&isnumber=10341342

Providing a metric indicating the potential occurrence of dangerous situations is highly essential for safety-critical robot applications. Due to the difficulty of finding a quantifiable, unambiguous representation however, such a metric has not been derived to date. In case of sensory devices, measurement uncertainties are usually provided by manufacturer specifications. Apart from that, several contributions demonstrate that the accuracy of neural networks is verifiable via the robustness. However, state-of-the-art literature is mainly concerned with theoretical investigations such that scarce attention has been devoted to the transfer of the robustness to real-world applications. To fill this gap, we show how the probabilistic robustness can be made useful for evaluating quantitative safety limits. Our key idea is to exploit the analogy between measurement uncertainties and the probabilistic robustness: While measurement uncertainties reflect possible shifts due to technical limitations, the robustness refers to the tolerated amount of distortions in the input data for an unaltered output. Inspired by this analogy, we combine both measures to quantify the system uncertainty online. We validate our method in different settings under real-world conditions. Our findings exemplify that incorporating the novel uncertainty metric effectively prevents the rate of dangerous situations in Human-Robot Collaboration. keywords: {Uncertainty;Measurement uncertainty;Neural networks;Probabilistic logic;Robot sensing systems;Distortion;Robustness},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342112&isnumber=10341342

Generative design (GD) aims to accelerate the design process compared to manual design, since GD allows exploring and exploiting the vast design space more efficiently. In the field of robotics, however, relevant research focuses mostly on the generation of fully-actuated open chain kinematics, which is trivial in mechanical engineering perspective. Within this paper, we address the problem of generative design of closed-chain linkage mechanisms. A GD algorithm has to be able to generate meaningful mechanisms which satisfy conditions of existence. We propose an optimization-driven algorithm for generation of planar closed-chain linkages to follow a predefined trajectory. The algorithm creates an unlimited range of physically reproducible design alternatives that can be further tested in simulation. These tests could be done in order to find solutions that satisfy extra criteria, e.g., desired dynamic behavior or low energy consumption. The proposed algorithm is called “respawn” since it builds a new linkage after the ancestor has been tested in a virtual environment in pursuit for the optimal solution. To show that the algorithm is general enough, we show a set of generated linkages that can be used for a wide class of robots. keywords: {Couplings;Heuristic algorithms;Software algorithms;Virtual environments;Transforms;Software;Trajectory},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341425&isnumber=10341342

However, current robot design practices overlook the impact of perception and design choices on a robot's learning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive methodology that accounts for the interplay between the robot's perception, hardware characteristics, and task requirements. Our approach optimizes the robot's morphology holistically, leading to improved learning and task execution proficiency. To achieve this, we introduce a Morphology-AGnostIc Controller (MAGIC), which helps with the rapid assessment of different robot designs. The MAGIC policy is efficiently trained through a novel PRIvileged Single-stage learning via latent alignMent (PRISM) framework, which also encourages behaviors that are typical of robot onboard observation. Our simulation-based results demonstrate that morphologies optimized holistically improve the robot performance by 15-20% on various manipulation tasks, and require 25x less data to match human-expert made morphology performance. In summary, our work contributes to the growing trend of learning-based approaches in robotics and emphasizes the potential in designing robots that facilitate better learning.

The robot can trot at 0.52 m/s or 4.4 body lengths per second with a 3.2 cost of transport (COT). Through locomotion experiments in both the real world and simulation we demonstrate that legs with different stiffness have an obvious impact on the robot's average speed, COT, and pronking height. When the robot is trotting at 4 Hz in the real world, changing the leg stiffness yields a maximum improvement of 37.1% in speed and 62.0% in COT, showing its great potential for future research on locomotion controller designs and leg stiffness optimizations. keywords: {Legged locomotion;Measurement;Force;Space exploration;Quadrupedal robots;Laminates;Robots},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342283&isnumber=10341342

The kinematic representation involves using length varying piecewise constant curvature segments to describe the deformed shape of the robot. Based on this kinematic representation, we can use overlapping length sensors to estimate the shape of continuously deformable bodies without prior knowledge of the current loading conditions. We show an implementation that assumes one change in curvature along the length of a joint, using string potentiometers as an arc length sensor, and an orientation measurement from the tip of the continuum joint. For 56 randomized joint configurations, we estimate the shape of a 250 mm long continually deformable robot with less then 2.5 mm of average error. The average error is reported for each of the 10 different equally spaced points along the length, demonstrating the ability to accurately represent the full shape of the soft robot. keywords: {Shape;Loading;Estimation;Kinematics;Soft robotics;Potentiometers;Position measurement;Robot sensing systems;Sensors;Intelligent robots},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342225&isnumber=10341342

Key to this is the development of closed-loop controllers that can help regulate pneumatic pressure in the device's actuators in an effort to induce controlled motion at the user's limbs and be able to track different types of trajectories. This work develops a controller for soft pneumatic actuators aimed to power a pediatric soft wearable robotic device prototype for upper extremity motion assistance. The controller tracks desired trajectories for a system of soft pneumatic actuators supporting two-degree-of-freedom shoulder joint motion on an infant-sized engineered mannequin. The degrees of freedom assisted by the actuators are equivalent to shoulder motion (abduction/adduction and flexion/extension). Embedded inertial measurement unit sensors provide real-time joint feedback. Experimental data from performing reaching tasks using the engineered mannequin are obtained and compared against ground truth to evaluate the performance of the developed controller. Results reveal the proposed controller leads to accurate trajectory tracking performance across a variety of shoulder joint motions. keywords: {Pneumatic actuators;Performance evaluation;Pediatrics;Trajectory tracking;Wearable computers;Shoulder;Soft robotics},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342528&isnumber=10341342

The online algorithm optimizes over so-called interception policies, which define the manner in which the robot arm intercepts the ball. In our case, these are composed of the state of the robot arm (position and velocity) at interception time. Gradient information is provided to the optimization algorithm via the mapping from the interception policy to the landing point of the ball on the table, which is approximated with a black-box and a grey-box approach. Our algorithm is applied to a robotic arm with four degrees of freedom that is driven by pneumatic artificial muscles. As a result, the robot arm is able to return the ball onto any predefined target on the table after about 2–5 iterations. We highlight the robustness of our approach by showing rapid convergence with both the black-box and the grey-box gradients. In addition, the small number of iterations required to reach close proximity to the target also underlines the sample efficiency.

Direct trajectory optimization suffers from the curse-of-dimensionality and incurs a high computational cost, while learning-based controller optimization methods are sensitive to hyper-parameter tuning. To overcome these limitations, we hypothesize that high fidelity soft robots can be both simulated and controlled by restricting to low-dimensional spaces. Under such assumption, we propose a two-stage algorithm to identify such simulation- and control-spaces. Our method first identifies the so-called simulation-space that captures the salient deformation modes, to which the robot's governing equation is restricted. We then identify the control-space, to which control signals are restricted. We propose a multi-fidelity Riemannian Bayesian bilevel optimization to identify task-specific control spaces. We show that the dimension of control-space can be less than 10 for a high-DOF soft robot to accomplish walking and swimming tasks, allowing low-dimensional MPC controllers to be applied to soft robots with tractable computational complexity. keywords: {Computational modeling;Soft robotics;Aerospace electronics;Robot sensing systems;Bayes methods;Task analysis;Read only memory},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341432&isnumber=10341342

Control and design of such actuators requires serviceable models that describe how they relate fluid pressure and flow to mechanical force and motion. We present a simple 2-port model of a bellows actuator that accounts for the relationships among fluid and mechanical variables imposed by the kinematics of the deforming bellows structure and accounts for elastic energy stored in the actuator's thermoplastic material structure. Elastic energy storage due to axial deformation is captured by revolving a differential strip whose linear elastic behavior is a nonlinear function of the actuator length. The model is evaluated through experiments in which either actuator length and pressure or force and pressure are imposed. The model has an error of 9.8% of the force range explored and yields insight into the effects of geometry changes. The resulting model can be used for model-based control or actuator design across the full operating range and can be exercised under either imposed force or imposed actuator length. keywords: {Actuators;Bellows;Solid modeling;Fluids;Computational modeling;Force;Loading},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341619&isnumber=10341342

Simaan, "Task and Configuration Space Compliance of Continuum Robots via Lie Group and Modal Shape Formulations," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 590-597, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341594.Abstract: Continuum robots suffer large deflections due to internal and external forces. Accurate modeling of their passive compliance is necessary for accurate environmental interaction, especially in scenarios where direct force sensing is not practical. This paper focuses on deriving analytic formulations for the compliance of continuum robots that can be modeled as Kirchhoff rods. Compared to prior works, the approach presented herein is not subject to the constant-curvature assumptions to derive the configuration space compliance, and we do not rely on computationally-expensive finite difference approximations to obtain the task space compliance. Using modal approximations over curvature space and Lie group integration, we obtain closed-form expressions for the task and configuration space compliance matrices of continuum robots, thereby bridging the gap between constant-curvature analytic formulations of configuration space compliance and variable curvature task space compliance. We first present an analytic expression for the compliance of a single Kirchhoff rod. We then extend this formulation for computing both the task space and configuration space compliance of a tendon-actuated continuum robot. We then use our formulation to study the tradeoffs between computation cost and modeling accuracy as well as the loss in accuracy from neglecting the Jacobian derivative term in the compliance model. Finally, we experimentally validate the model on a tendon-actuated continuum segment, demonstrating the model's ability to predict passive deflections with error below 11.5% percent of total arc length. keywords: {Jacobian matrices;Shape;Computational modeling;Motion segmentation;Soft robotics;Predictive models;Robot sensing systems},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341594&isnumber=10341342

Spenko, "A Localization Framework for Boundary Constrained Soft Robots," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 598-603, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341817.Abstract: Soft robots possess unique capabilities for adapting to the environment and interacting with it safely. However, their deformable nature also poses challenges for controlling their movement. In particular, the large deformations of a soft robot make it difficult to localize its individual body parts, which in turn impedes effective control. This paper introduces a novel localization framework designed for soft robots that are constrained by boundaries and benefit from unique hardware architecture. To this end, we propose a method that exploits the flexible boundaries of the robot to create an onboard sensor capable of measuring the relative distances between its sub-robots. This measurement data is incorporated into a linear Kalman filter for accurate localization. We evaluate the framework's performance in benchmark and dynamic cases and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving localization accuracy compared to an IMU-based approach. The results also show that the proposed method achieves sufficient localization accuracy for contact-based mapping, enabling the robot to sense the location of obstacles in the environment. Finally, we validate the proposed framework using a physical prototype of a boundary-constrained soft robot and demonstrate its ability to accurately estimate the robot's shape. This framework has the potential to enable soft robots to autonomously navigate and map unknown environments, which could be beneficial for a variety of exploration tasks. keywords: {Location awareness;Shape;Navigation;Prototypes;Soft robotics;Robot sensing systems;Hardware},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341817&isnumber=10341342

These depend on soft-body dynamics, high-dimensional actuation patterns, and external/onboard forces. This paper presents scalable methods and platforms to study the impact of weight distribution and actuation patterns on fully untethered modular soft robots. An extendable Vibrating Intelligent Piezo-Electric Robot (eViper), together with an open-source Simulation Framework for Electroactive Robotic Sheet (SFERS) implemented in PyBullet, was developed as a platform to analyze the complex weight-locomotion interaction. By integrating power electronics, sensors, actuators, and batteries onboard, the eViper platform enables rapid design iteration and evaluation of different weight distribution and control strategies for the actuator arrays. The design supports both physics-based modeling and data-driven modeling via onboard automatic data-acquisition capabilities. We show that SFERS can provide useful guidelines for optimizing the weight distribution and actuation patterns of the eViper, thereby achieving maximum speed or minimum cost of transport (COT). keywords: {Actuators;Heuristic algorithms;Soft robotics;Robot sensing systems;Software;Power electronics;Intelligent sensors},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342402&isnumber=10341342

However, the potentially infinite number of Degrees of Freedom makes their modeling a daunting task, and in many cases only an approximated description is available. This challenge makes reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches inefficient when deployed on a realistic scenario, due to the large domain gap between models and the real platform. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, how Domain Randomization (DR) can solve this problem by enhancing RL policies for soft robots with: i) robustness w.r.t. unknown dynamics parameters; ii) reduced training times by exploiting drastically simpler dynamic models for learning; iii) better environment exploration, which can lead to exploitation of environmental constraints for optimal performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel algorithmic extension to previous adaptive domain randomization methods for the automatic inference of dynamics parameters for deformable objects. We provide an extensive evaluation in simulation on four different tasks and two soft robot designs, opening interesting perspectives for future research on Reinforcement Learning for closed-loop soft robot control. keywords: {Training;Adaptation models;Heuristic algorithms;Reinforcement learning;Soft robotics;Robustness;Trajectory},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342537&isnumber=10341342

In this paper we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, closed-loop control of the configuration space variables of a soft robotic arm, composed of independently controllable segments, using a Cosserat rod model of the robot and the distributed sensing and actuation capabilities of the segments. Our controller solves the inverse dynamic problem by simulating the Cosserat rod model in MATLAB using a computationally efficient numerical solution scheme, and it applies the computed control output to the actual robot in real time. The position and orientation of the tip of each segment are measured in real time, while the remaining unknown variables that are needed to solve the inverse dynamics are estimated simultaneously in the simulation. We implement the controller on a multi-segment silicone robotic arm with pneumatic actuation, using a motion capture system to measure the segments' positions and orientations. The controller is used to reshape the arm into configurations that are achieved through combinations of bending and extension deformations in 3D space. Although the possible deformations are limited for this robot platform, our study demonstrates the potential for implementing the control approach on a wide range of continuum robots in practice. The resulting tracking performance indicates the effectiveness of the controller and the accuracy of the simulated Cosserat rod model. keywords: {Motion segmentation;Pneumatic systems;Soft robotics;Position measurement;Robot sensing systems;Manipulators;Mathematical models},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342160&isnumber=10341342

Firstly, a payload controller is presented considering the dynamic coupling between the UAV and the payload to accomplish the active suppression of payload swing and the complex payload trajectory tracking. Secondly, different from the simplification of obstacles in most approaches, we propose three Insetting Formation (IF) algorithms for the complete obstacle shape to generate collision-free waypoints for the cooperative transportation system. An IF strategy is proposed by integrating three IF algorithms to improve the success rate of obstacle avoidance and reduce the algorithm complexity for performing the aggressive flight. Finally, we verify the robustness and high performance of the proposed algorithm through benchmark comparison and real-world experiments. Moreover, our source code is released as an open-source ros package. keywords: {Trajectory planning;Trajectory tracking;Shape;Source coding;Transportation;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Robustness},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341351&isnumber=10341342

The proposed method uses the full dynamical model of the kinematically coupled robot system and builds on a hierarchical quadratic programming (HQP) formulation to enforce dynamical inequality constraints such as joint torques or internal loads. This ensures optimal tracking of an object trajectory, while additional objectives with lower priority are optimized on the prior solution space. Therefore, the redundancy of the inherent load distribution problem between the two arms can be eliminated. With this approach, higher object loads can be manipulated compared to non-optimized methods. Simulations with a 14 degree of freedom (dof) dual-arm robotic system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. The real-time feasibility is guaranteed with an average computation time of less than 0.35 milliseconds at a control rate of 1 kilohertz. keywords: {Time-frequency analysis;Torque;Computational modeling;Dynamics;Trajectory;Quadratic programming;Robots},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341854&isnumber=10341342

In large-scale monitoring scenarios, deploying a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers improved spatial coverage and robustness against individual failures. However, a key challenge is cooperative path planning for the UAVs to efficiently achieve a joint mission goal. We propose a novel multi-agent informative path planning approach based on deep reinforcement learning for adaptive terrain monitoring scenarios using UAV teams. We introduce new network feature representations to effectively learn path planning in a 3D workspace. By leveraging a counterfactual baseline, our approach explicitly addresses credit assignment to learn cooperative behaviour. Our experimental evaluation shows improved planning performance, i.e. maps regions of interest more quickly, with respect to non-counterfactual variants. Results on synthetic and real-world data show that our approach has superior performance compared to state-of-the-art non-learning-based methods, while being transferable to varying team sizes and communication constraints. keywords: {Deep learning;Three-dimensional displays;Reinforcement learning;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Path planning;Robustness;Planning},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342516&isnumber=10341342

Mobility of robots enables the behavior of pursuing better visibility, which is constrained by sensor field of view (FoV) and occlusion objects. We first extend prior work to detect, maintain and share occlusion information explicitly, allowing us to generate occlusion-aware planning even if à priori semantic occlusion information is unavailable. The efficacy of active sensing approaches is often evaluated according to estimation error and information gain metrics. However, these metrics do not directly explain the level of cooperative behavior engendered by the active sensing algorithms. Next, we extract different emergent cooperative behaviors that stem from the same underlying algorithms but manifest differently under differing scenarios. In particular, we highlight and demonstrate three emergent behavior patterns in active sensing MRS: (i) Change of tracking responsibility between agents when tracking trajectories with divergent directions or due to a re-allocation of the resource among heterogeneous agents; (ii) Awareness of occlusions to a trajectory and temporal leave-and-return of the sensing agent; (iii) Sharing of local occlusion objects in MRS that subsequently improves the awareness of occlusion. keywords: {Measurement;Target tracking;Heuristic algorithms;Semantics;Robot sensing systems;Behavioral sciences;Sensors;Active Sensing;Visibility;Occlusion-Aware;Cooperative Emergent Behavior;Dynamic Occlusion Map},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342357&isnumber=10341342

Choset, "Multi-Objective Sparse Sensing with Ergodic Optimization," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 673-678, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341535.Abstract: We consider a search problem where a robot has one or more types of sensors, each suited to detecting different types of targets or target information. Often, information in the form of a distribution of possible target locations, or locations of interest, may be available to guide the search. When multiple types of information exist, then a distribution for each type of information must also exist, thereby making the search problem that uses these distributions to guide the search a multi-objective one. In this paper, we consider a multi-objective search problem when the “cost” to use a sensor is limited. To this end, we leverage the ergodic metric, which drives agents to spend time in regions proportional to the expected amount of information there. We define the multi-objective sparse sensing ergodic (MO-SS-E) metric in order to optimize when and where each sensor measurement should be taken while planning trajectories that balance the multiple objectives. We observe that our approach maintains coverage performance as the number of samples taken considerably degrades. Further empirical results on different multi-agent problem setups demonstrate the applicability of our approach for both homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-agent teams. keywords: {Measurement;Sensor fusion;Robot sensing systems;Search problems;Sensor systems;Sensors;Trajectory},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341535&isnumber=10341342

Specifically, we incorporate “support” action which an agent can take to reduce the cost for its teammate to traverse some high cost edges. Due to this added feature, the graph traversal is no longer a standard multi-agent path planning problem. To solve this new problem, we propose a novel formulation that poses it as a planning problem in a joint state space: the joint state graph (JSG). Since the edges of JSG implicitly incorporate the support actions taken by the agents, we are able to now optimize the joint actions by solving a standard single-agent path planning problem in JSG. One main drawback of this approach is the curse of dimensionality in both the number of agents and the size of the graph. To improve scalability in graph size, we further propose a hierarchical decomposition method to perform path planning in two levels. We provide both theoretical and empirical complexity analyses to demonstrate the efficiency of our two algorithms. keywords: {Costs;Statistical analysis;Scalability;Path planning;Planning;Complexity theory;Game theory},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341820&isnumber=10341342

We develop a cooperative driving framework to incorporate dif-ferent human behavior aspects, including the attentiveness of a driver and the tendency of the driver following advising commands. To demonstrate the framework, we consider the merging coordination between a human-driven vehicle and an autonomous vehicle (AV) in a connected environment. We propose a stochastic model predictive controller (sMPC) to address the stochasticity in human driving behavior and design coordinated merging actions to optimize the AV input and influence human driving behavior through advising commands. Simulation and human-in-the-loop (HITL) experimental results show that our formulation is capable of accommodating a distracted driver and optimizing AV inputs based on human driving behavior recognition. keywords: {Merging;Stochastic processes;Predictive models;Human in the loop;Behavioral sciences;Autonomous vehicles;Intelligent robots},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341565&isnumber=10341342

However, within these application spaces, communication is often unreliable, causing inefficiencies or outright failures to arise in most MRS algorithms. Many researchers tackle this problem by requiring all robots to either maintain communication using proximity constraints or assuming that all robots will execute a predetermined plan over long periods of disconnection. The latter method allows for higher levels of efficiency in a MRS, but failures and environmental uncertainties can have cascading effects across the system, especially when a mission objective is complex or time-sensitive. To solve this, we propose an epistemic planning framework that allows robots to reason about the system state, leverage heterogeneous system makeups, and optimize information dissemination to disconnected neighbors. Dynamic epistemic logic formalizes the propagation of belief states, and epistemic task allocation and gossip is accomplished via a mixed integer program using the belief states for utility predictions and planning. The proposed framework is validated using simulations and experiments with heterogeneous vehicles. keywords: {Uncertainty;Space communications;Power system protection;Search problems;Planning;Resource management;Multi-robot systems},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341352&isnumber=10341342

An observation embedding with a self-attention mechanism is presented to model the robot-robot and robot-environment interactions. A soft wall-following rule is developed to improve the trajectory smoothness. Our method belongs to reactive planning, but environment properties are implicitly encoded. The total amount of robots in our method can be scaled up to any number. The performance improvement over a vanilla APF and RL method has been demonstrated via numerical simulations. Experiments are also performed using quadrotors to further illustrate the competence of our method. keywords: {Heuristic algorithms;Dynamics;Reinforcement learning;Numerical simulation;Robot sensing systems;Real-time systems;Planning},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342416&isnumber=10341342

Nam, "Coordination of Multiple Mobile Manipulators for Ordered Sorting of Cluttered Objects," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 712-718, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342179.Abstract: We present a coordination method for multiple mobile manipulators to sort objects in clutter. We consider the object rearrangement problem in which the objects must be sorted into different groups in a particular order. In clutter, the order constraints could not be easily satisfied since some objects occlude other objects so the occluded ones are not directly accessible to the robots. Those objects occluding others need to be moved more than once to make the occluded objects accessible. Such rearrangement problems fall into the class of nonmonotone rearrangement problems which are computation-ally intractable. While the nonmonotone problems with order constraints are harder, involving with multiple robots requires another computation for task allocation. In this work, we aim to develop a fast method, albeit sub-optimally, for the multi-robot coordination for ordered sorting in clutter. The proposed method finds a sequence of objects to be sorted using a search such that the order constraint in each group is satisfied. The search can solve nonmonotone instances that require temporal relocation of some objects to access the next object to be sorted. Once a complete sorting sequence is found, the objects in the sequence are assigned to multiple mobile manipulators using a greedy task allocation method. We develop four versions of the method with different search strategies. In the experiments, we show that our method can find a sorting sequence quickly (e.g., 4.6 sec with 20 objects sorted into five groups) even though the solved instances include hard nonmonotone ones. The extensive tests and the experiments in simulation show the ability of the method to solve the real-world sorting problem using multiple mobile manipulators. keywords: {Geometry;Robot kinematics;Search problems;Manipulators;Planning;Resource management;Task analysis},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342179&isnumber=10341342

Existing approaches to distributed tracking make limiting assumptions regarding the relative spatial relationship of sensors, including assuming a static sensor network or that perfect localization is available. Instead, we develop an algorithm based on the Kalman-Consensus filter for distributed tracking that properly leverages localization uncertainty in collaborative tracking. Further, our method allows the team to maintain an accurate understanding of dynamic objects in the environment by realigning robot frames and incorporating frame alignment uncertainty into our object tracking formulation. We evaluate our method in hardware on a team of three mobile ground robots tracking four people. Compared to previous works that do not account for localization error, we show that MOTLEE is resilient to localization uncertainties, enabling accurate tracking in distributed, dynamic settings with mobile tracking sensors. keywords: {Location awareness;Uncertainty;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Limiting;Collaboration;Object detection;Hardware},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342388&isnumber=10341342

However, with only an onboard RGB camera, it is still a challenging work for a quadruped manipulator to track the motion of a dynamic object moving with unknown and changing velocities. To address this problem, this manuscript proposes a novel image-based visual servoing (IBVS) approach consisting of three elements: a spherical projection model, a robust super-twisting observer, and a model predictive controller (MPC). The spherical projection model decouples the visual error of the dynamic target into linear and angular ones. Then, with the presence of the visual error, the robustness of the observer is exploited to estimate the unknown and changing velocities of the dynamic target without depth estimation. Finally, the estimated velocity is fed into the model predictive controller (MPC) to generate joint torques for the quadruped manipulator to track the motion of the dynamical target. The proposed approach is validated through hardware experiments and the experimental results illustrate the approach's effectiveness in improving the autonomy of the quadruped manipulator. keywords: {Visualization;Target tracking;Dynamics;Estimation;Predictive models;Observers;Cameras},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341608&isnumber=10341342

However, uncertainty coupled with contact discontinuities can lead to failure, especially in real-world environments with unexpected height variations such as rocky hills or curbs. To enable dynamic traversal of extreme terrain, this work introduces 1) a proprioception-based gait planner for estimating unknown hybrid events due to elevation changes and responding by modifying contact schedules and planned footholds online, and 2) a two-degree-of-freedom tail for improving contact-independent control and a corresponding decoupled control scheme for better versatility and efficiency. Simulation results show that the gait planner significantly improves stability under unforeseen terrain height changes compared to methods that assume fixed contact schedules and footholds. Further, tests have shown that the tail is particularly effective at maintaining stability when encountering a terrain change with an initial angular disturbance. The results show that these approaches work synergistically to stabilize locomotion with elevation changes up to 1.5 times the leg length and tilted initial states. keywords: {Legged locomotion;Schedules;Uncertainty;Simulation;Dynamics;Tail;Dynamic scheduling},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342384&isnumber=10341342

Y. You et al., "Run and Catch: Dynamic Object-Catching of Quadrupedal Robots," 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Detroit, MI, USA, 2023, pp. 743-750, doi: 10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341977.Abstract: Quadrupedal robots are performing increasingly more real-world capabilities, but are primarily limited to locomotion tasks. To expand their task-level abilities of object acquisition, i.e., run-to-catch as frisbee catching for dogs, this paper developed a control pipeline using stereo vision for legged robots which allows for dynamic catching balls while the robot is in motion. To achieve high-frame-rate tracking, we designed a ball that can actively emit homogeneous infrared (IR) light and then located the flying ball based on binocular vision positioning using the onboard RealSense D450 camera with an additional IR bandpass filter. The camera was mounted on top of a 2-DoF head to gain a full view of the target ball. A state estimation module was developed to fuse the vision positioning, camera motor readings, localization result of RealSense T265 equipped on the back, and the legged odometry output altogether. With the use of a ballistic model, we achieved a robust estimation of both the ball and robot positions in an inertial coordinate. Additionally, we developed a close-loop catching strategy and employed trajectory prediction so that tracking and run-to-catch were performed simultaneously, which is critical for such drastically dynamic and precise tasks. The proposed approach was validated through both static testing and dynamic catch experiments conducted on the CyberDog robot with a high success rate. keywords: {Legged locomotion;Robot kinematics;Robot vision systems;Cameras;Stereo vision;Quadrupedal robots;Odometry},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341977&isnumber=10341342

The deep reinforcement learning (DRL) exhibits the huge potential in environmental adaptability, while its stability issues remain open. On the other hand, the quadruped robot dynamic model contains a lot of useful information that is beneficial to the robust control. The combination of DRL with model-based control may take both strengths and hold promises in better robustness. In this paper, the DRL and the proposed model-based controller are firmly integrated in a novel manner such that the proposed model-based controller is able to rectify the gait commands generated by DRL based on the system dynamic model so as to enhance the robustness of the quadruped robot against the external disturbances. Besides, a potential energy function is introduced to achieve the compliant contact. The stability of the proposed method is ensured in terms of passivity analysis. Several physical experiments are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed method. keywords: {Potential energy;Robust control;Legged locomotion;Adaptation models;System dynamics;Reinforcement learning;Robustness},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341908&isnumber=10341342

Ground reaction force (GRF) is a crucial state variable for quadrupedal control. Most GRF observations are implemented in lightweight quadrupeds, with little consideration of the loading being static or slippery on the body. However, the load information is vital to the heavy-duty quadruped applied in transportation tasks. In this paper, we disassembled the whole-body dynamics into the body dynamics combined with the individual floating single-leg dynamics and completed observing the virtual coupling effects between the body and legs. Based on the observed coupling force and centroidal dynamics (CD), the GRF of a stance leg is obtained without the awareness of body weight, movement, and load information. Furthermore, we utilized the body dynamics and the observed virtual force to obtain the body's unknown payload. By reconstructing the moment balance equation, we obtained the payload's position concerning the body coordinate. Compared to conventional quadrupedal GRF observation methods, this framework achieves higher observation accuracy in heavy quadrupeds without load and body information. Additionally, it enables real-time calculation of load magnitude and position. keywords: {Legged locomotion;Robot kinematics;Friction;Force;Dynamics;Robot sensing systems;Mathematical models;Quadrupedal robots;Force sensors;Payloads},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342158&isnumber=10341342

However, the time-consuming computation caused by massive population evolution in offline evolutionary-based jumping framework significantly limits the popularity in the quadrupedal field. This paper presents a time-friendly online motion planning framework based on meta-heuristic Differential evolution (DE), Latin hypercube sampling, and Configuration space (DLC). The DLC framework establishes a multidimensional optimization problem leveraging centroidal dynamics to determine the ideal trajectory of the center of mass (CoM) and ground reaction forces (GRFs). The configuration space is introduced to the evolutionary optimization in order to condense the searching region. Latin hypercube sampling offers more uniform initial populations of DE under limited sampling points, accelerating away from a local minimum. This research also constructs a collection of pre-motion trajectories as a warm start when the objective state is in the neighborhood of the pre-motion state to drastically reduce the solving time. The proposed methodology is successfully validated via real robot experiments for online jumping trajectory optimization with different jumping motions (e.g., ordinary jumping, flipping, and spinning). keywords: {Sociology;Hypercubes;Libraries;Planning;Quadrupedal robots;Spinning;Statistics},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342082&isnumber=10341342

In addition to conventional sensors, including one body Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and joint encoders, we attach an additional IMU to each calf link of the robot just above the foot. An extended Kalman filter is used to fuse data from all sensors to estimate the robot's body and foot positions in the world frame. Using the additional IMUs, the filter is able to reliably determine foot contact modes and detect foot slips without tactile or pressure-based foot contact sensors. This sensing solution is validated in various hardware experiments, which confirm that it can reduce position drift by nearly an order of magnitude compared to conventional approaches with only a very modest increase in hardware and computational costs. keywords: {Legged locomotion;Measurement units;Propioception;Sensor fusion;Hardware;Reliability;Odometry},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342061&isnumber=10341342

A method is developed that outputs optimal gait characteristics and leg designs for a robot to move with maximum efficiency or speed. Also, generic guidelines are presented, which answer questions such as: which speed should be selected for maximum efficiency, or which is the optimal leg architecture (serial/ parallel) and leg length for maximum efficiency or speed. keywords: {Legged locomotion;Procurement;Analytical models;Actuators;Technological innovation;Motion segmentation;Quadrupedal robots},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341886&isnumber=10341342

Unfortunately, the regions that are richer in potential discoveries, such as impact craters, caves, and volcanic terraces, are hard to access with wheeled robots. Recent advances in legged-based approaches have shown the potential of the technology to overcome difficult terrains such as slopes and slippery surfaces. In this work, we focus on locomotion for sandy slopes, comparing standard walking policies with a novel crawling-based gait for quadrupedal robots. We fine-tuned a state-of-the-art locomotion framework and introduced hardware modifications to the robot ANYmal, which enables walking on its knees. Moreover, we integrated a novel metric for stability, the stability margin, in the training process to increase robustness in such conditions. We benchmarked the locomotion policies in simulation and in real-world experiments on a martian soil simulant. Our results show a significant improvement in terms of robustness and stability, especially at higher slope angles beyond 15 degrees. keywords: {Legged locomotion;Knee;Training;Surface morphology;Robot sensing systems;Stability analysis;Robustness},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341665&isnumber=10341342

However, obstacles can impede their progress by requiring the robots to either slow down to step over obstacles or modify their path to circumvent the obstacles. We propose a motion optimization framework for quadruped robots that incorporates non-steerable wheels and dynamic jumps, enabling them to perform hybrid wheeled-legged locomotion while overcoming obstacles without slowing down. Our approach involves a model predictive controller that uses a time-varying rigid body dynamics model of the robot, including legs and wheels, to track dynamic motions such as jumping. We also introduce a method for driving with minimal leg swings to reduce energy consumption by sparing the effort involved in lifting the wheels. Our method was tested successfully on the wheeled Mini Cheetah and the Unitree AlienGo robots.

However, for such a systems to be valuable in real-world scenarios, they must be able to autonomously and robustly navigate irregular terrains. In many cases, robots that are sold on the market do not provide such abilities, being able to perform only blind locomotion. Furthermore, their controller cannot be easily modified by the end-user, requiring a new and time-consuming control synthesis. In this work, we present a fast local motion planning pipeline that extends the capabilities of a black-box walking controller that is only able to track high-level reference velocities. More precisely, we learn a set of motion models for such a controller that maps high-level velocity commands to Center of Mass (CoM) and footstep motions. We then integrate these models with a variant of the $A$ * algorithm to plan the CoM trajectory, footstep sequences, and corresponding high-level velocity commands based on visual information, allowing the quadruped to safely traverse irregular terrains at demand. keywords: {Legged locomotion;Visualization;Uncertainty;Tracking;Pipelines;Closed box;Stairs},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342440&isnumber=10341342

The previous Polygon-based Random Tree (PRT) search algorithm for support polygon generation is extended to irregular terrain while considering friction and internal force limitations. By characterizing terrain, unreachable areas are excluded from search to increase efficiency. A one-step rolling motion primitive is generated based on the kinematics, statics, and constraints of VTT. The locomotion planning is completed by transforming and connecting multiple motion primitives with respect to the desired support polygons. The algorithm's performance is verified by conducting simulations in multiple types of environments. keywords: {Three-dimensional displays;Friction;Force;Static analysis;Kinematics;Planning;Topology},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341447&isnumber=10341342

In practice, however, tracking error can be affected by many factors, and could lead to potential collisions when the robot must traverse a cluttered environment. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel receding-horizon motion planning approach based on Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control theory – a flexible sampling-based control technique that requires minimal assumptions on vehicle dynamics and cost functions. This flexibility is leveraged to propose a motion planning framework that also considers a data-informed risk function. Using the MPPI algorithm as a motion planner also reduces the number of samples required by the algorithm, relaxing the hardware requirements for implementation. The proposed approach is validated through trajectory generation for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), where fast motion increases trajectory tracking error and can lead to collisions with nearby obstacles. Simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that the MPPI motion planner proactively adapts to the obstacles that the UAV must negotiate, slowing down when near obstacles and moving quickly when away from obstacles, resulting in a complete reduction of collisions while still producing lively motion. keywords: {Adaptation models;Trajectory tracking;Heuristic algorithms;Predictive models;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Hardware;Planning},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341501&isnumber=10341342

The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) is relevant in this context as Multi-Robot Systems (MRSs) allow for better coverage of the area of interest, simultaneous data collection at different locations, and an increase in the overall robustness and efficiency of the mission. However, route planning for AMVs in dynamic ocean environments is challenging due to the coupling of environmental and vehicle dynamics. We propose a multi-objective formulation that accounts for the trade-offs between visiting multiple task locations and energy consumption by the vehicles subject to a time budget. This work focuses on vehicles that can maintain a constant net speed but can be adapted to vehicles with constant thrust. Different from existing approaches, our method is able to leverage time-varying ocean currents to improve the energy efficiency of resulting routes. We validate our approach experimentally by superimposing ocean flow models with benchmark instances of the TOP. keywords: {Oceans;Pipelines;Energy efficiency;Robustness;Planning;Multi-robot systems;Vehicle dynamics},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341645&isnumber=10341342

This paper studies a Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Ergodic Search (MA-MO-ES) approach to this problem where each objective or task is to cover a domain subject to an information map. The goal is to allocate coverage tasks to agents so that all maps are explored ergodically. The combinatorial nature of task allocation makes it computationally expensive to solve for optimal allocation using brute force. Apart from a large number of possible allocations, computing the cost of a task allocation is itself an expensive planning problem. To mitigate the computational challenge, we present a branch and bound-based algorithm with pruning techniques that reduce the number of allocations to be searched to find optimal coverage task allocation. We also present an approach to leverage the similarity between information maps to further reduce computation. Extensive testing on 147 randomly generated test cases shows an order of magnitude improvement in runtime compared to an exhaustive brute force approach. keywords: {Runtime;Costs;Force;Search problems;Planning;Resource management;Task analysis},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341353&isnumber=10341342

This is challenging due to the complex dependencies between navigation and high-level reasoning, requiring the robot to explore a vast space of feasible motions and goal sequences. Our approach combines machine learning and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solvers with sampling-based motion planning. Machine learning predicts distances and directions between locations, considering obstacles and robot dynamics, which the TSP solver uses to compute promising tours. Sampling-based motion planning expands a motion tree to follow the tours along the predicted directions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments with vehicle and snake-like robot models operating in unstructured environments with multiple goals. keywords: {Navigation;Computational modeling;Dynamics;Machine learning;Traveling salesman problems;Planning;Space exploration},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341945&isnumber=10341342

However, efficient neural planners that can adapt to unpredictable dynamic environments, a highly demanded scenario in many practical applications, are still under-explored. To fill this research gap and enrich the existing motion planning approaches, in this pa-per, we propose DynGMP, a graph neural network (GNN)-based planner that provides high-performance planning solutions in unpredictable dynamic environments. By fully leveraging the prior exploration experience and minimizing the replanning cost incurred by environmental change, DynGMP achieves high planning performance and efficiency simultaneously. Empirical evaluations across different environments show that DynGMP can achieve close to 100% success rate with fast planning speed and short path cost. Compared with existing non-learning and learning-based counterparts, DynGMP shows very significant planning performance improvement, e.g., at least 2.7×, 2.2×, $2.4\times$ and $2\times$ faster planning speed with low path distance in four environments, respectively. keywords: {Learning systems;Costs;Heuristic algorithms;Design methodology;Dynamics;Graph neural networks;Planning},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342326&isnumber=10341342

A well-developed state space enables the desirable distribution of limited computational resources between task planning and motion planning. However, developing such task-level state spaces can be non-trivial in practice. In this paper, we consider a long horizon mobile manipulation domain including repeated navigation and manipulation. We propose Symbolic State Space Optimization (S3O) for computing a set of abstracted locations and their 2D geometric groundings for generating task-motion plans in such domains. Our approach has been extensively evaluated in simulation and demonstrated on a real mobile manipulator working on clearing up dining tables.

The core idea of our model is encoding single-agent's spatial-temporal information in the first stage and exploring multi-agents' spatial-temporal interactions in the second stage. By comprehensively utilizing attention mechanism, LSTM, graph convolution network and temporal transformer in the two stages, our model is able to learn rich dynamic and interaction information of all agents. Our model achieves the highest performance when comparing with existing map-free methods and also exceeds most map-based state-of-the-art methods on the Argoverse dataset. In addition, our model also exhibits a faster inference speed than the baseline methods. keywords: {Convolution;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Transformer cores;Transformers;Encoding;Trajectory},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342199&isnumber=10341342

Indeed, contrary to predict-then-plan paradigms, game-theoretic planners do not ignore the interactive nature of the problem, and simultaneously predict the behaviour of other agents while considering change in one's policy. This, however, comes at the expense of computational complexity, especially as the number of agents considered grows. In fact, planning with more than a handful of agents can quickly become intractable, disqualifying game-theoretic planners as possible candidates for large scale planning. In this paper, we propose a planning algorithm enabling the use of game-theoretic planners in robot systems with a large number of agents. Our planner is based on the reality of locality of information and thus deploys local games with a selected subset of agents in a receding horizon fashion to plan collision avoiding trajectories. We propose five different principled schemes for selecting game participants and compare their collision avoidance performance. We observe that the use of Control Barrier Functions for priority ranking is a potent solution to the player selection problem for motion planning. keywords: {Jacobian matrices;Costs;Scalability;Games;Planning;Trajectory;Collision avoidance},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341677&isnumber=10341342

Moving objects all have unique property information, we propose a method that utilizes deep learning for 3D dynamic environment perception, while taking into account limitations in computing resources. For safer dynamic avoidance, we first model the dynamic target and integrate it into a static grid occupancy map, and then construct a gradient field based on its attribute information. To achieve autonomous UAV flight in dynamic environments, we design an adaptive planning method based on gradient optimization, which achieves significant computational savings by autonomously adjusting the planning frequency and using manually constructed gradients instead of maintaining a signed distance field (SDF). We have integrated the above approach into a customised quadrotor system and thoroughly tested it in real-world, verifying its flexibility to handle multiple objects with variable speed motion in complex enviroment. keywords: {Three-dimensional displays;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamics;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Dynamic scheduling;Planning;Trajectory},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10341486&isnumber=10341342

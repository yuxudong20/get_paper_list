                <td>Learning to interact with deformable tree branches with minimal damage is challenging due to their intricate geometry and inscrutable dynamics. Furthermore, traditional vision-based modelling systems suffer from implicit occlusions in dense foliage, severely changing lighting conditions, and limited field of view, in addition to having a significant computational burden preventing real-time deployment.In this work, we simulate a procedural forest with realistic, self-similar branching structures derived from a parametric L-system model, actuated with crude spring abstractions, mirroring real-world variations with domain randomisation over the morphological and dynamic attributes. We then train a novel Proprioceptive Contact-Aware Policy (PCAP) for a reach task using reinforcement learning, aided by a whole-arm contact detection classifier and reward engineering, without external vision, tactile, or torque sensing. The agent deploys novel strategies to evade and mitigate contact impact, favouring a reactive exploration of the task space. Finally, we demonstrate that the learned behavioural patterns can be transferred zero-shot from simulation to real, allowing the arm to navigate around real branches with unseen topology and variable occlusions while minimising the contact forces and expected ruptures.</td>

                <td>The increasing complexity of tasks in robotics demands efficient strategies for multitask and continual learning. Traditional models typically rely on a universal policy for all tasks, facing challenges such as high computational costs and catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks. To address these issues, we introduce a sparse, reusable, and flexible policy, Sparse Diffusion Policy (SDP). By adopting Mixture of Experts (MoE) within a transformer-based diffusion policy, SDP selectively activates experts and skills, enabling task-specific learning without retraining the entire model. It not only reduces the burden of active parameters but also facilitates the seamless integration and reuse of experts across various tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks in both simulators and the real world show that SDP 1) excels in multitask scenarios with negligible increases in active parameters, 2) prevents forgetting in continual learning new tasks, and 3) enables efficient task transfer, offering a promising solution for advanced robotic applications. More demos and codes can be found on our https://anonymous.4open.science/w/sparse_diffusion_policy-24E7/.</td>

                <td>Robot behavior policies trained via imitation learning are prone to failure under conditions that deviate from their training data. Thus, algorithms that monitor learned policies at test time and provide early warnings of failure are necessary to facilitate scalable deployment. We propose a runtime monitoring framework that splits the detection of failures into two complementary categories: 1) Erratic failures, which we propose to detect using a statistical measure of temporal action consistency, and 2) task progression failures, where we use VLMs to detect when the policy confidently and consistently takes actions that do not solve the task. Our approach has two key strengths. First, because learned policies exhibit diverse failure modes, combining complementary detectors leads to significantly higher accuracy at failure detection. Second, using a statistical temporal action consistency measure ensures that we quickly detect when multi-modal, generative policies exhibit erratic behavior at negligible computation cost. In contrast, we only use VLMs to detect failure modes that are less time-sensitive. We demonstrate our approach in the context of diffusion policies trained on a multi-modal domain and simulated bi-manual robotic manipulation domains. The resultant system, unifying temporal consistency detection with VLM runtime monitoring, detects 15% more failures than using either of the two detectors, thus highlighting the importance of assigning specialized detectors to complementary categories of failure.</td>

                <td>We introduce Vocal Sandbox, a framework for enabling seamless human-robot collaboration in situated environments. In our framework, systems are characterized by their ability to adapt and continually learn from rich, mixed-modality interactions: users can not only teach new high-level planning behaviors through spoken dialogue, but they can also provide teaching feedback via modalities such as object keypoints or demonstrations to learn new low-level skills in real-time. To learn from this feedback, we propose new methods for behavior induction and skill learning that support mixed-modality feedback, using pretrained models and lightweight learning algorithms to drive adaptation. Each component is further designed to be interpretable and generates visualization traces for users to build an understanding and co-adapt to a robot's capabilities, localizing teaching feedback to the correct level of abstraction. We evaluate our framework across two settings -- gift bag assembly and LEGO stop-motion animation. In the first setting, we run systematic ablations and user studies with 8 non-expert participants, spanning 23 hours of total robot interaction time; users are able to teach 17 new high-level behaviors, spanning an average of 16 new low-level skills, resulting in 22.1% less required supervision relative to non-adaptive baselines. Qualitatively, users strongly prefer our system due to its ease of use (+31.2%), helpfulness (+13.0%), and overall performance (+18.2%). Finally, we scale our framework to a more complex setting with an expert and robot collaborating to film a stop-motion animated movie, where the expert teaches the robot complex dynamic motion skills over a full hour of continued collaboration, shooting a 30-second (138 frame) stop-motion animation.

Theia’s rich visual representations encode diverse visual knowledge, enhancing downstream robot learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Theia outperforms its teacher models and prior robot learning models using less training data and smaller model sizes. Additionally, we quantify the quality of pre-trained visual representations and hypothesize that higher entropy in feature norm distributions leads to improved robot learning performance.</td>

However, the generated robot motions by these controllers often lack safety and performance, resulting in jerky movements. In this work, a novel modular framework for zero-shot motion planning for manipulation tasks is developed. The modular components do not require any motion-planning-specific training. An LLM is combined with a vision model to create Python code that interacts with a novel path planner, which creates a piecewise linear reference path with bounds around the path that ensure safety. An optimization-based planner, the BoundMPC framework, is utilized to execute optimal, safe, and collision-free trajectories along the reference path. The effectiveness of the approach is shown on various everyday manipulation tasks in simulation and experiment, shown in the video at www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/42d2.</td>

These methods either rely on switching between a discrete set of skills or learn a distribution across gaits using complex black-box models. Alternatively, we present Gaitor, which learns a disentangled and 2D representation across locomotion gaits. This learnt representation forms a planning space for closed-loop control delivering continuous gait transitions and perceptive terrain traversal. Gaitor’s latent space is readily interpretable and we discover that during gait transitions, novel unseen gaits emerge. The latent space is disentangled with respect to footswing heights and lengths. This means that these gait characteristics can be varied independently in the 2D latent representation. Together with a simple terrain encoding and a learnt planner operating in the latent space, Gaitor can take motion commands including desired gait type and swing characteristics all while reacting to uneven terrain. We evaluate Gaitor in both simulation and the real world on the ANYmal C platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work learning a unified and interpretable latent space for multiple gaits, resulting in continuous blending between different locomotion modes on a real quadruped robot.</td>

                <td>Contact-rich manipulation plays an important role in everyday life, but uncertain parameters pose significant challenges to model-based planning and control. To address this issue, domain adaptation and domain randomization have been proposed to learn robust policies. However, they either lose the generalization ability to diverse instances or perform conservatively due to neglecting instance-specific information. In this paper, we propose a bi-level approach to learn robust manipulation primitives, including parameter-augmented policy learning using multiple models with tensor approximation, and parameter-conditioned policy retrieval through domain contraction. This approach unifies domain randomization and domain adaptation, providing optimal behaviors while keeping generalization ability. We validate the proposed method on three contact-rich manipulation primitives: hitting, pushing, and reorientation. The experimental results showcase the superior performance of our approach in generating robust policies for instances with diverse physical parameters.</td>

                <td>Data collection in imitation learning often requires significant, laborious human supervision, such as numerous demonstrations and/or frequent environment resets for methods that incorporate reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose an alternative approach, MILES: a fully autonomous, self-supervised data collection paradigm and show that this enables efficient policy learning from just a single demonstration and a single environment reset. Our method, MILES, autonomously learns a policy for returning to and then following the single demonstration, whilst being self-guided during data collection, eliminating the need for additional human interventions. We evaluate MILES across several real-world tasks, including tasks that require precise contact-rich manipulation, and find that, under the constraints of a single demonstration and no repeated environment resetting, MILES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives like reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning.

                <td>Control tuning and adaptation present a significant challenge to the usage of robots in diverse environments. It is often nontrivial to find a single set of control parameters by hand that work well across the broad array of environments and conditions that a robot might encounter. Automated adaptation approaches must utilize prior knowledge about the system while adapting to significant domain shifts to find new control parameters quickly. In this work, we present a general framework for online controller adaptation that deals with these challenges. We combine meta-learning with Bayesian recursive estimation to learn prior predictive models of system performance that quickly adapt to online data, even when there is significant domain shift. These predictive models can be used as cost functions within efficient sampling-based optimization routines to find new control parameters online that maximize system performance. Our framework is powerful and flexible enough to adapt controllers for four diverse systems: a simulated race car, a simulated quadrupedal robot, and a simulated and physical quadrotor.</td>

                <td>Abstract: Human actions manipulating articulated objects, such as opening and closing a drawer, can be categorized into multiple modalities we define as interaction modes. Traditional robot learning approaches lack discrete representations of these modes, which are crucial for empirical sampling and grounding. In this paper, we present ActAIM2, which learns a discrete representation of robot manipulation interaction modes in a purely unsupervised fashion, without the use of expert labels or simulator-based privileged information. Utilizing novel data collection methods involving simulator rollouts, ActAIM2 consists of an interaction mode selector and a low-level action predictor. The selector generates discrete representations of potential interaction modes with self-supervision, while the predictor outputs
corresponding action trajectories. Our method is validated through its success rate in manipulating articulated objects and its robustness in sampling meaningful actions from the discrete representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate ActAIM2’s effectiveness in enhancing manipulability and generalizability over baselines and ablation studies.

                <td>Model-free reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful method for developing robust robot control policies capable of navigating through complex and unstructured terrains.
The effectiveness of these methods hinges on two essential elements: 
(1) the use of massively parallel physics simulations to expedite policy training, 
and
(2) the deployment of an environment generator tasked with crafting terrains that are sufficiently challenging yet attainable, thereby facilitating continuous policy improvement. 
Existing methods of environment generation often rely on heuristics constrained by a set of parameters, limiting the diversity and realism.
In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Diffusion Terrain Generator (ADTG), a novel method that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to dynamically expand an existing training environment by adding more diverse and complex terrains tailored to the current policy.
Unlike conventional methods, ADTG adapts the terrain complexity and variety based on the evolving capabilities of the current policy.
This is achieved through two primary mechanisms:
First, by blending terrains from the initial dataset within their latent spaces using performance-informed weights, ADTG creates terrains that suitably challenge the policy. 
Secondly, by manipulating the initial noise in the diffusion process, ADTG seamlessly shifts between creating similar terrains for fine-tuning the current policy and entirely novel ones for expanding training diversity.
Our experiments show that the policy trained by ADTG outperforms both procedural generated and natural environments, along with popular navigation methods.</td>

Collecting real data at scale with task centric ground truth labels, like contact forces and slip, is a challenge further compounded by sensors of various form factor differing in aspects like lighting and gel markings. To tackle this we turn to self-supervised learning (SSL) that has demonstrated remarkable performance in computer vision. We present Sparsh, a family of SSL models that can support various vision-based tactile sensors, alleviating the need for custom labels through pre-training on 460k+ tactile images with masking and self-distillation in pixel and latent spaces. We also build TacBench, to facilitate standardized benchmarking across sensors and models, comprising of five tasks ranging from comprehending tactile properties to enabling physical perception and manipulation planning. In evaluations, we find that SSL pre-training for touch representation outperforms task and sensor-specific end-to-end training by 98.7\% on average over TacBench, and Sparsh (DINO) and Sparsh (IJEPA) are the most competitive, indicating the merits of learning in latent space for tactile images.

Our proposed framework utilizes a multi-critic reinforcement learning algorithm to effectively handle the mixture of dense and sparse rewards. Additionally, it employs a transformer-based encoder to accommodate a variable number of input targets, each associated with specific time-to-arrivals. 
Throughout simulation and hardware experiments, we demonstrate that our framework can effectively satisfy the target keyframe sequence at the required times. 
The experiments also show that the multi-critic method significantly reduces the effort for hyperparameter tuning compared to the standard single-critic alternative. 
Moreover, the proposed transformer-based architecture enables robots to anticipate future goals, which results in quantitative improvements in their ability to reach their targets.</td>

However, the success comes at a cost. Their reliance on VLM backends with billions of parameters leads to high computational costs and inference latency, limiting the testing scenarios to mainly quasi-static tasks and hindering performance in dynamic tasks requiring rapid interactions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes \textbf{HiRT}, a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{R}obot \textbf{T}ransformer framework that enables flexible frequency and performance trade-off. HiRT keeps VLMs running at low frequencies to capture temporarily invariant features while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency vision-based policy guided by the slowly updated features. Experiment results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. Empirically, we achieve a 58\% reduction in inference time delay while maintaining comparable success rates. Additionally, on novel dynamic manipulation benchmarks which are challenging for previous VLA models, HiRT improves the success rate from 48\% to 75\%.</td>

In this work, we introduce ManiWAV: an 'ear-in-hand' data collection device to collect in-the-wild human demonstrations with synchronous audio and visual feedback, and a corresponding policy interface to learn robot manipulation policy directly from the demonstrations. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system through four contact-rich manipulation tasks that require either passively sensing the contact events and modes, or actively sensing the object surface materials and states.

However, due to differences in morphology, such as varying degrees of joint freedom and force limits, exact replication of human behaviors may not be feasible for humanoid robots. Consequently, incorporating physically infeasible MoCap data in training datasets can adversely affect the performance of the robot policy. To address this issue, we propose a bi-level optimization-based imitation learning framework that alternates between optimizing both the robot policy and the target MoCap data. Specifically, we first develop a generative latent dynamics model using a novel self-consistent auto-encoder, which learns sparse and structured motion representations while capturing desired motion patterns in the dataset. The dynamics model is then utilized to generate reference motions while the latent representation regularizes the bi-level motion imitation process. Experiments conducted on a simulated realistic humanoid robot demonstrate that our proposed method enhances the robot policy by modifying reference motions to be physically consistent.</td>

We theoretically analyze the $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ symmetry of full 6-DoF control and characterize when a diffusion model is $\mathrm{SO}(2)$-equivariant. We furthermore evaluate the method empirically on a set of 12 simulation tasks in MimicGen, and show that it obtains a success rate that is, on average, 21.9\% higher than the baseline Diffusion Policy.

To this end, we first build a simulator by integrating Gaussian Splatting with quadrotor flight dynamics, and then, train robust navigation policies using Liquid neural networks. In this way, we obtain a full-stack imitation learning protocol that combines advances in 3D Gaussian splatting radiance field rendering, crafty programming of expert demonstration training data, and the task understanding capabilities of Liquid networks. Through a series of quantitative flight tests, we demonstrate the robust transfer of navigation skills learned in a single simulation scene directly to the real world. We further show the ability to maintain performance beyond the training environment under drastic distribution and physical environment changes. Our learned Liquid policies, trained on single target maneuvers curated from a photorealistic simulated indoor flight only, generalize to multi-step hikes onboard a real hardware platform outdoors.</td>

                <td>Stable locomotion in precipitous environments is an essential task for quadruped robots, requiring the ability to resist various external disturbances. Recent neural policies enhance robustness against disturbances by learning to resist external forces sampled from a fixed distribution in the simulated environment. However, the force generation process doesn’t consider the robot’s current state, making it difficult to identify the most effective direction and magnitude that can push the robot to the most unstable but recoverable state. Thus, challenging cases in the buffer are insufficient to optimize robustness. In this paper, we propose to model the robust locomotion learning process as an adversarial interaction between the locomotion policy and a learnable disturbance that is conditioned on the robot state to generate appropriate external forces. To make the joint optimization stable, our novel $H_{\infty}$ constraint mandates the bound of the ratio between the cost and the intensity of the external forces. We verify the robustness of our approach in both simulated environments and real-world deployment, on quadrupedal locomotion tasks and a more challenging task where the quadruped performs locomotion merely on hind legs.

Previous works bridge this gap with a sim-to-real way. However, this way explicitly or implicitly forces the simulated data to adapt to the noisy real data when training grasp detectors, where the positional drift and structural distortion within the camera noise will harm the grasp learning. In this work, we propose a Real-to-Sim framework for 6-DoF Grasp detection, named R2SGrasp, with the key insight of bridging this gap in a real-to-sim way, which directly bypasses the camera noise in grasp detector training through an inference-time real-to-sim adaption. To achieve this real-to-sim adaptation, our R2SGrasp designs the Real-to-Sim Data Repairer (R2SRepairer) to mitigate the camera noise of real depth maps in data-level, and the Real-to-Sim Feature Enhancer (R2SEnhancer) to enhance real features with precise simulated geometric primitives in feature-level. To endow our framework with the generalization ability, we construct a large-scale simulated dataset cost-efficiently to train our grasp detector, which includes 64,000 RGB-D images with 14.4 million grasp annotations. Sufficient experiments show that R2SGrasp is powerful and our real-to-sim perspective is effective. The real-world experiments further show great generalization ability of R2SGrasp.

However, demonstrating expert behavior in the action space of the agent becomes unwieldy when robots have complex, unintuitive morphologies. We consider the practical setting where an agent has a dataset of prior interactions with the environment and is provided with observation-only expert demonstrations. Typical learning from observations approaches have required either learning an inverse dynamics model or a discriminator as intermediate steps of training. Errors in these intermediate one-step models compound during downstream policy learning or deployment. We overcome these limitations by directly learning a multi-step utility function that quantifies how each action impacts the agent's divergence from the expert's visitation distribution. Using the principle of duality, we derive DILO (Dual Imitation Learning from Observations), an algorithm that can leverage arbitrary suboptimal data to learn imitating policies without requiring expert actions. DILO reduces the learning from observations problem to that of simply learning an actor and a critic, bearing similar complexity to vanilla offline RL. This allows DILO to gracefully scale to high dimensional observations, and demonstrate improved performance across the board.</td>

Instead, RL agents that can act over useful, temporally extended skills rather than low-level actions can learn new tasks more easily.
Prior work in skill-based RL either requires expert supervision to define useful skills, which is hard to scale, or learns a skill-space from offline data with heuristics that limit the adaptability of the skills, making them difficult to transfer during downstream RL.
Our approach, EXTRACT, instead utilizes pre-trained vision language models to extract a discrete set of semantically meaningful skills from offline data, each of which is parameterized by continuous arguments, without human supervision. 
This skill parameterization allows robots to learn new tasks by only needing to learn when to select a specific skill and how to modify its arguments for the specific task.
We demonstrate through experiments in sparse-reward, image-based, robot manipulation environments that EXTRACT can more quickly learn new tasks than prior works, with major gains in sample efficiency and performance over prior skill-based RL.</td>

By virtue of being minimal, sketches can further help disambiguate task-relevant from irrelevant objects. We present RT-Sketch, a goal-conditioned policy for manipulation that takes a hand-drawn sketch of the desired scene as input, and outputs actions. We train RT-Sketch on a dataset of trajectories paired with synthetically generated goal sketches. We evaluate this approach on six manipulation skills involving tabletop object rearrangements on an articulated countertop. Experimentally we find that RT-Sketch performs comparably to image or language-conditioned agents in straightforward settings, while achieving greater robustness when language goals are ambiguous or visual distractors are present. Additionally, we show that RT-Sketch handles sketches with varied levels of specificity, ranging from minimal line drawings to detailed, colored drawings.

In particular, for the case of piano-playing, Youtube is full of videos of professional pianists playing a wide myriad of songs.
In our work, we leverage these demonstrations to learn a generalist piano-playing agent capable of playing any arbitrary song.
Our framework is divided into three parts: a data preparation phase to extract the informative features from the Youtube videos,
a policy learning phase to train song-specific expert policies from the demonstrations and a policy distillation phase to distil the policies into a single generalist agent.
We explore different policy designs to represent the agent and evaluate the influence of the amount of training data on the generalization capability of the agent to novel songs not available in the dataset.
We show that we are able to learn a policy with up to 57% F1 score on unseen songs.</td>

Constrained model-based RL (CMBRL) presents a promising approach to this problem. These methods are designed to learn constraint-adhering policies through constrained optimization approaches. Yet, such policies often fail to meet stringent safety requirements during learning and exploration. Our solution ``CASE'' aims to reduce the instances where constraints are breached during the learning phase. Specifically, CASE integrates techniques for optimizing constrained policies and employs planning-based safety filters as backup policies, effectively lowering constraint violations during learning and making it a more reliable option than other recent constrained model-based policy optimization methods.</td>

                <td>Traditional autonomous driving methods adopt modular design, decomposing tasks into sub-tasks, including perception, prediction, planning, and control. In contrast, end-to-end autonomous driving directly outputs actions from raw sensor data, avoiding error accumulation. However, training an end-to-end model requires a comprehensive dataset. Without adequate data, the end-to-end model exhibits poor generalization capabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been applied to enhance the generalization property of end-to-end driving models. Most studies explore LLMs in an open-loop manner, where the output actions are compared to those of experts without direct activation in the real world. Other studies in closed-loop settings examine their results in simulated environments. In comparison, this paper proposes an efficient architecture that integrates multimodal LLMs into end-to-end real-world driving models in a closed-loop setting. The LLM periodically takes raw sensor data to generate high-level driving instructions. In our architecture, LLMs can effectively guide the end-to-end model, even at a slower rate than the raw sensor data, because updates aren't needed every time frame. This architecture relaxes the trade-off between the latency and inference quality of the LLM. It also allows us to choose a wide variety of LLMs to improve high-level driving instructions and minimize fine-tuning costs. Consequently, our architecture reduces the data collection requirements because the LLMs do not directly output actions, and we only need to train a simple imitation learning model to output actions. In our experiments, the training data for the end-to-end model in a real-world environment consists of only simple obstacle configurations with one traffic cone, while the test environment is more complex and contains different types of obstacles. Experiments show that the proposed architecture enhances the generalization capabilities of the end-to-end model even without fine-tuning the LLM.</td>

To integrate new user preferences in a zero-shot manner, our proposed Text2Interaction framework invokes a large language model to generate a task plan, motion preferences as Python code, and parameters of a safe controller. By maximizing the combined probability of task completion and user satisfaction instead of a weighted sum of rewards, we can reliably find plans that fulfill both requirements. We find that 83% of users working with Text2Interaction agree that it integrates their preferences into the robot's plan, and 94% prefer Text2Interaction over the baseline. Our ablation study shows that Text2Interaction aligns better with unseen preferences than other baselines while maintaining a high success rate.</td>

State-of-the-art works in this area, however, have yet to represent deformable transformations, despite the ubiquity of non-rigid bodies in real world settings. As a first step towards bridging this gap, we propose "cross-displacement" - an extension of the principles of relative placement to geometric relationships between deformable objects - and present a novel vision-based method to learn cross-displacement for a non-rigid task through dense diffusion. To this end, we demonstrate our method's ability to generalize to unseen object instances, out-of-distribution scene configurations, and multimodal goals on a highly deformable cloth-hanging task beyond the scope of prior works.</td>

Using a two-finger gripper with a built-in depth camera that can control its torque by limiting motor current, we demonstrate that LLM-parameterized but first-principles grasp policies outperform both traditional adaptive grasp policies and direct LLM-as-code policies on a custom benchmark of 12 delicate and deformable items including food, produce, toys, and other everyday items, spanning two orders of magnitude in mass and required pick-up force. We then improve property estimation and grasp performance on variable size objects with model finetuning on property-based comparisons and eliciting such comparisons via chain-of-thought prompting.

Learning skills from demonstrations can be an effective strategy, but such methods often have limited generalizability beyond training data and struggle to solve long-horizon tasks. To overcome this, we propose to synergistically combine two paradigms: Neural Object Descriptors (NODs) that produce generalizable object-centric features and Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) frameworks that chain short-horizon skills to solve multi-step tasks. We introduce NOD-TAMP, a TAMP-based framework that extracts short manipulation trajectories from a handful of human demonstrations, adapts these trajectories using NOD features, and composes them to solve broad long-horizon, contact-rich tasks. NOD-TAMP solves existing manipulation benchmarks with a handful of demonstrations and significantly outperforms prior NOD-based approaches on new tabletop manipulation tasks that require diverse generalization. Finally, we deploy NOD-TAMP on a number of real-world tasks, including tool-use and high-precision insertion. For more details, please visit https://sites.google.com/view/nod-tamp/.</td>

We evaluate SELFI in multiple real-world environments and report improvements in terms of collision avoidance, as well as more socially compliant behavior, measured by a human user study. SELFI enables us to quickly learn useful robotic behaviors with less human interventions such as pre-emptive behavior for the pedestrians, collision avoidance for small and transparent objects, and avoiding travel on uneven floor surfaces.

Conventional methods struggle to build complete shapes and estimate accurate poses due to partial occlusions and sensor noise. They require dense observations to cover all objects, which is challenging to achieve in robotics trajectories.  Recent work introduces generative shape priors for object-level mapping from sparse views, but is limited to single-category objects. In this work, we propose a General Object-level Mapping system, GOM, which leverages a 3D diffusion model as shape prior with multi-category support and outputs Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for both texture and geometry for all objects in a scene. 
GOM includes an effective formulation to guide a pre-trained diffusion model with extra nonlinear constraints from sensor measurements without finetuning. We also develop a probabilistic optimization formulation to fuse multi-view sensor observations and diffusion priors for joint 3D object pose and shape estimation. 
Our GOM system demonstrates superior multi-category mapping performance from sparse views, and achieves more accurate mapping results compared to state-of-the-art methods on the real-world benchmarks.

We prompt the LLM to output code for a function with open parameters, which, together with environmental constraints, can be viewed as a Continuous Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CCSP). This CCSP can be solved through sampling or optimization to find a skill sequence and continuous parameter settings that achieve the goal while avoiding constraint violations. Additionally, we consider cases where the LLM proposes unsatisfiable CCSPs, such as those that are kinematically infeasible, dynamically unstable, or lead to collisions, and re-prompt the LLM to form a new CCSP accordingly. Experiments across simulated and real-world domains demonstrate that our proposed strategy, \OursNoSpace, is capable of solving a wide range of complex manipulation tasks with realistic constraints much more efficiently and effectively than existing baselines.</td>

However, we demonstrate that NeRFs are inappropriate for scene changes due to its implicitness and point-based methods are inaccurate for part localization without rendering-based optimization. To amend these issues, we propose GraspSplats. Using depth supervision and a novel reference feature computation method, GraspSplats can generate high-quality scene representations under 60 seconds. We further validate the advantages of Gaussian-based representation by showing that the explicit and optimized geometry in GraspSplats is sufficient to natively support (1) real-time grasp sampling and (2) dynamic and articulated object manipulation with point trackers.
With extensive experiments on a Franka robot, we demonstrate that GraspSplats significantly outperforms existing methods under diverse task settings. In particular, GraspSplats outperforms NeRF-based methods like F3RM and LERF-TOGO, and 2D detection methods. The code will be released.</td>

Additionally, object occlusions in a scenario of contact uncertainty and where the motion of the object evolves independently from the robot becomes a critical problem, which previous literature fails to address. We present a method for learning visuotactile state estimators and uncertainty-aware control policies for non-prehensile manipulation under occlusions, by leveraging diverse interaction data from privileged policies trained in simulation. We formulate the estimator within a Bayesian deep learning framework, to model its uncertainty, and then train uncertainty-aware control policies by incorporating the pre-learned estimator into the reinforcement learning (RL) loop, both of which lead to significantly improved estimator and policy performance. Therefore, unlike prior non-prehensile research that relies on complex external perception set-ups, our method successfully handles occlusions after sim-to-real transfer to robotic hardware with a simple onboard camera.</td>

While recent works use Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn preferences from user demonstrations, they encounter two fundamental challenges.
First, there is inherent ambiguity in interpreting user actions, as multiple preferences can often explain a single observed behavior.
Second, not all user preferences are practically feasible due to geometric constraints in the environment.
To address these challenges, we introduce APRICOT, a novel approach that merges LLM-based Bayesian active preference learning with constraint-aware task planning.

We argue that a straightforward way to obtain such knowledge is by asking humans to observe and assist robot policy execution in the real world. The robots can then learn from humans to close various sim-to-real gaps. We propose TRANSIC, a data-driven approach to enable successful sim-to-real transfer based on a human-in-the-loop framework. TRANSIC allows humans to augment simulation policies to overcome various unmodeled sim-to-real gaps holistically through intervention and online correction. Residual policies can be learned from human corrections and integrated with simulation policies for autonomous execution. We show that our approach can achieve successful sim-to-real transfer in complex and contact-rich manipulation tasks such as furniture assembly. Through synergistic integration of policies learned in simulation and from humans, TRANSIC is effective as a holistic approach to addressing various, often coexisting sim-to-real gaps.

The motivation behind this strategy is that long-horizon goals offer limited guidance for efficient exploration and accurate state transition. We develop a diffusion strategy-based high-level policy to generate reasonable subgoals as waypoints, preferring states that more easily lead to the final goal. Additionally, we learn state-goal value functions to encourage efficient subgoal reaching. These two components naturally integrate into the off-policy actor-critic framework, enabling efficient goal attainment through informative exploration.

In this work, we introduce a framework to learn object dynamics directly from multi-view RGB videos by explicitly considering the robot's action trajectories and their effects on scene dynamics. We utilize the 3D Gaussian representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to train a particle-based dynamics model using Graph Neural Networks. This model operates on sparse control particles downsampled from the densely tracked 3D Gaussian reconstructions. By learning the neural dynamics model on offline robot interaction data, our method can predict object motions under varying initial configurations and unseen robot actions. The 3D transformations of Gaussians can be interpolated from the motions of control particles, enabling the rendering of predicted future object states and achieving action-conditioned video prediction. The dynamics model can also be applied to model-based planning frameworks for object manipulation tasks. We conduct experiments on various kinds of deformable materials, including ropes, clothes, and stuffed animals, demonstrating our framework's ability to model complex shapes and dynamics.

                <td>Understanding robot behaviors and experiences through natural language is crucial for developing intelligent and transparent robotic systems. Recent advancement in large language models (LLMs) makes it possible to translate complex, multi-modal robotic experiences into coherent, human-readable narratives. However, grounding real-world robot experiences into natural language is challenging due to many reasons, such as multi-modal nature of data, differing sample rates, and data volume. We introduce RONAR, an LLM-based system that generates natural language narrations from robot experiences, aiding in behavior announcement, failure analysis, and human interaction to recover failure. Evaluated across various scenarios, RONAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods and improves failure recovery efficiency. Our contributions include a multi-modal framework for robot experience narration, a comprehensive real-robot dataset, and empirical evidence of RONAR's effectiveness in enhancing user experience in system transparency and failure analysis.</td>

                <td>Good pre-trained visual representations could enable robots to learn visuomotor policy efficiently. Still, existing representations take a one-size-fits-all-tasks approach that comes with two important drawbacks: (1) Being completely task-agnostic, these representations cannot effectively ignore any task-irrelevant information in the scene,  and (2) They often lack the representational capacity to handle unconstrained/complex real-world scenes. Instead, we propose to train a large combinatorial family of representations organized by scene entities: objects and object parts. This hierarchical object decomposition for task-oriented representations (HODOR) permits selectively assembling different representations specific to each task while scaling in representational capacity with the complexity of the scene and the task. In our experiments, we find that HODOR outperforms prior pre-trained representations, both scene vector representations and object-centric representations, for sample-efficient imitation learning across 5 simulated and 5 real-world manipulation tasks. We further find that the invariances captured in HODOR are inherited into downstream policies, which can robustly generalize to out-of-distribution test conditions, permitting zero-shot skill chaining.

In order to operate effectively in uncontrolled, real world spaces, robots must navigate safely by executing tasks around obstacles while in proximity to hazards. Creating safe movement for robotic manipulators remains a long-standing challenge in robotics, particularly in environments with partial observability. In partially observed settings, classical techniques often fail. Learned end-to-end motion policies can infer correct solutions in these settings, but are as-yet unable to produce reliably safe movement when close to obstacles. In this work, we introduce \ave, a novel end-to-end system for generating collision-free motion toward a target, even targets close to obstacles. \ave consists of two parts: 1) Motion Policy Transformer (M$pi$Former), a transformer architecture for end-to-end joint space control from point clouds, trained on over 1,000,000 expert trajectories and 2) a fine-tuning procedure we call Refining on Optimized Policy Experts (ROPE), which uses optimization to provide demonstrations of safe behavior in challenging states. With these techniques, we are able to successfully solve over 63% of reaching problems that caused the previous state of the art method to fail, resulting in an overall success rate of over 91\% in challenging manipulation settings.</td>

We unify these two lines of work and present 3D Diffuser Actor , a neural policy equipped with a novel 3D denoising transformer that fuses information from the 3D visual scene, a language instruction and proprioception to predict the noise in noised 3D robot pose trajectories. 3D Diffuser Actor sets a new state-of-the-art on RLBench with an absolute performance gain of 18.1% over the current SOTA on a multi-view setup and an absolute gain of 13.1% on a single-view setup. On the CALVIN benchmark, it improves over the current SOTA by a 9% relative increase. It also learns to control a robot manipulator in the real world from a handful of demonstrations. Through thorough comparisons with the current SOTA policies and ablations of our model, we show 3D Diffuser Actor ’s design choices dramatically outperform 2D representations, regression and classification objectives, absolute attentions, and holistic non-tokenized 3D scene embeddings.</td>

In this work, we propose a framework for learning an end-to-end vision-based whole-body-control parkour policy for humanoid robots that overcomes multiple parkour skills without any motion prior. Using the parkour policy, the humanoid robot can jump on a 0.42m platform, leap over hurdles, 0.8m gaps, and much more. It can also run at 1.8m/s in the wild and walk robustly on different terrains. We test our policy in indoor and outdoor environments to demonstrate that it can autonomously select parkour skills while following the rotation command of the joystick.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a relative action formulation 
which enables successful policy training and deployment using its approximate kinematics data. A promising outcome of this approach is that the large repository of clinical data, which contains approximate kinematics, may be directly utilized for robot learning without further corrections. We demonstrate our findings through successful execution of three fundamental surgical tasks, including tissue manipulation, needle handling, and knot-tying.</td>

Unlike in NLP, we find that these methods are hard to apply out of the box due to varying action spaces and dynamics across robots. Our method, ReMix, employs early stopping and action normalization and discretization to counteract these issues. Through extensive experimentation on both the Bridge and OpenX datasets, we demonstrate that data curation can have an outsized impact on downstream performance. Specifically, domain weights learned by ReMix outperform uniform weights by over 40\% on average and human-selected weights by over 20\% on datasets used to train the RT-X models.</td>

VIRL utilizes a visual encoder that extracts object-wise features for graph nodes and a graph encoder that derives properties from graphs constructed from detected objects in each frame. The encoded representations are enforced to align videos temporally and reconstruct in-scene objects. The pretrained visual graph encoder is then utilized to construct a dense reward function for policy learning by measuring latent distances between current frames and the goal frame. Our empirical evaluation on the X-MAGICAL and Robot Visual Pusher benchmark demonstrates that VIRL effectively handles tasks necessitating both granular visual attention and broader global feature consideration, and exhibits robust generalization to $\textit{extrapolation}$ tasks and domains not seen in demonstrations.

However, this goal is challenging because different navigation tasks require different strategies. The scarcity of instruction navigation data hinders training an instruction navigation model with varied strategies. Therefore, previous methods are all constrained to one specific type of navigation instruction. In this work, we propose InstructNav, a generic instruction navigation system. InstructNav makes the first endeavor to handle various instruction navigation tasks without any navigation training or pre-built maps. To reach this goal, we introduce Dynamic Chain-of-Navigation (DCoN) to unify the planning process for different types of navigation instructions. Furthermore, we propose Multi-sourced Value Maps to model key elements in instruction navigation so that linguistic DCoN planning can be converted into robot actionable trajectories. With InstructNav, we complete the R2R-CE task in a zero-shot way for the first time and outperform many task-training methods. Besides, InstructNav also surpasses the previous SOTA method by 10.48% on the zero-shot Habitat ObjNav and by 86.34% on demand-driven navigation DDN.

Modelling architectures that leverage known physics can substantially reduce the complexity of system-identification, but break down in the face of complex real-world phenomena such as contact. This paper introduces a novel framework for learning predictive models for contact-rich system which seamlessly integrates structured first-principles modeling techniques with black-box autoregressive models. Specifically, we develop an ensemble of probabilistic models to estimate external forces, conditioned on historical observations and actions, and integrate these predictions using known Lagrangian dynamics. This semi-structured approach enables us to make accurate predictions far into the future with substantially fewer training samples than prior methods. We leverage this capability to push the sample-complexity boundary for real-world model-based reinforcement learning.

                <td>State-of-the-art 3D object detectors are often trained on massive labeled datasets. However, annotating 3D bounding boxes remains prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, particularly for LiDAR. Instead, recent works demonstrate that self-supervised pre-training with unlabeled data can improve detection accuracy with limited labels. Contemporary methods adapt best-practices for self-supervised learning from the image domain to point clouds (such as contrastive learning). However, publicly available 3D datasets are considerably smaller and less diverse than those used for image-based self-supervised learning, limiting their effectiveness. We do note, however, that such data is naturally collected in a multimodal fashion, often paired with images. Rather than pre-training with only self-supervised objectives, we argue that it is better to bootstrap point cloud representations using image-based foundation models trained on internet-scale image data. Specifically, we propose a shelf-supervised approach (e.g. supervised with off-the-shelf image foundation models) for generating zero-shot 3D bounding boxes from paired RGB and LiDAR data. Pre-training 3D detectors with such pseudo-labels yields significantly better semi-supervised detection accuracy than prior self-supervised pretext tasks. Importantly, we show that image-based shelf-supervision is helpful for training LiDAR-only and multi-modal (RGB + LiDAR) detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on nuScenes and WOD, significantly improving over prior work in limited data settings.</td>

In this paper, we propose to model the magnetic field of large environments based on GP regression. We first modify a deterministic training conditional sparse GP by accounting for magnetic field physics to map small environments efficiently. We then scale the model on larger scenes by introducing a local expert aggregation framework. It splits the scene into subdomains, fits a local expert on each, and then aggregates expert predictions in a differentiable and probabilistic way. We evaluate our model on real and simulated data and show that we can smoothly map a three-story building in a few hundred milliseconds.</td>

For the LLM to generate actionable plans, scene context must be provided, often through a map. Recent works have shifted from explicit maps with fixed semantic classes to implicit open vocabulary maps based on queryable embeddings capable of representing any semantic class. However, embeddings cannot directly report the scene context as they are implicit, requiring further processing for LLM integration. To address this, we propose an explicit text-based map that can represent thousands of semantic classes while easily integrating with LLMs due to their text-based nature by building upon large-scale image recognition models. We study how entities in our map can be localized and show through evaluations that our text-based map localizations perform comparably to those from open vocabulary maps while using two to four orders of magnitude less memory.

Mainly, we introduce two distinct frameworks: return-conditioned and return-weighted decision tree policies (RCDTP and RWDTP), both of which achieve notable speed in agent training as well as inference, with training typically lasting less than a few minutes. Despite the simplification inherent in this reformulated approach to offline RL, our agents demonstrate performance that is at least on par with the established methods. We evaluate our methods on D4RL datasets for locomotion and manipulation, as well as other robotic tasks involving wheeled and flying robots. Additionally, we assess performance in delayed/sparse reward scenarios and highlight the explainability of these policies through action distribution and feature importance.</td>

RiEMann can efficiently train the visuomotor policy from scratch with 5 to 10 demonstrations for a manipulation task, generalizes to unseen SE(3) transformations and instances of target objects, resists visual interference of distracting objects, and follows the near real-time pose change of the target object. The scalable SE(3)-equivariant action space of RiEMann supports both pick-and-place tasks and articulated object manipulation tasks. In simulation and real-world 6-DOF robot manipulation experiments, we test RiEMann on 5 categories of manipulation tasks with a total of 25 variants and show that RiEMann outperforms baselines in both task success rates and SE(3) geodesic distance errors (reduced by 68.6%), and achieves 5.4 frames per second (fps) network inference speed.</td>

                <td>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for solving robotic manipulation tasks.
However, it is challenging to apply the RL algorithms directly in the real world.
For one thing, RL is data-intensive and typically requires millions of interactions with environments, which are impractical in real scenarios. 
For another, it is necessary to make heavy engineering efforts to design reward functions manually. 
To address these issues, we leverage foundation models in this paper. 
We propose Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Priors (RLFP) to utilize guidance and feedback from policy, value, and success-reward foundation models.
Within this framework, we introduce the Foundation-guided Actor-Critic (FAC) algorithm, which enables embodied agents to explore more efficiently with automatic reward functions.
The benefits of our framework are threefold: (1) \textit{sample efficient}; (2) \textit{minimal and effective reward engineering}; (3) \textit{agnostic to foundation model forms and robust to noisy priors}. Our method achieves remarkable performances in various manipulation tasks on both real robots and in simulation. Across 5 dexterous tasks with real robots, FAC achieves an average success rate of 86\% after one hour of real-time learning. 
Across 8 tasks in the simulated Meta-world, FAC achieves 100\% success rates in 7/8 tasks under less than 100k frames (about 1-hour training), outperforming baseline methods with manual-designed rewards in 1M frames. 
We believe the RLFP framework can enable future robots to explore and learn autonomously in the physical world for more tasks.</td>

However, existing unsupervised GCRL methods often struggle to cover a wide range of states in complex environments due to their limited exploration and sparse or noisy rewards for GCRL. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised GCRL method that leverages TemporaL Distance-aware Representations (TLDR). Our approach selects faraway goals to initiate exploration and compute intrinsic exploration rewards and goal-reaching rewards. Specifically, our exploration policy seeks states with large temporal distances (i.e. covering a large state space), while the goal-conditioned policy learns to minimize the temporal distance to the goal (i.e. reaching the goal). Our experimental results in six simulated robotic locomotion and manipulation environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous unsupervised GCRL methods in achieving a wide variety of states.</td>

In this work, we propose Meta-Control, the first LLM-enabled automatic control synthesis approach that creates customized state representations and control strategies tailored to specific tasks. Our core insight is that a meta-control system can be built to automate the thought process that human experts use to design control systems. Specifically, human experts heavily use a model-based, hierarchical (from abstract to concrete) thought model, then compose various dynamic models and controllers together to form a control system. Meta-Control mimics the thought model and harnesses LLM's extensive control knowledge with Socrates' "art of midwifery" to automate the thought process. Meta-Control stands out for its fully model-based nature, allowing rigorous analysis, generalizability, robustness, efficient parameter tuning, and reliable real-time execution.</td>

                <td>Robot learning has proven to be a general and effective technique for programming manipulators. Imitation learning is able to teach robots solely from human demonstrations but is bottlenecked by the capabilities of the demonstrations. Reinforcement learning uses exploration to discover better behaviors; however, the space of possible improvements can be too large to start from scratch. And for both techniques, the learning difficulty increases proportional to the length of the manipulation task. Accounting for this, we propose SPIRE, a system that first uses Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) to decompose tasks into smaller learning subproblems and second combines imitation and reinforcement learning to maximize their strengths. We develop novel strategies to train learning agents when deployed in the context of a planning system. We evaluate SPIRE on a suite of long-horizon and contact-rich robot manipulation problems. We find that SPIRE outperforms prior approaches that integrate imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and planning by 35% to 50% in average task performance, is 6 times more data efficient in the number of human demonstrations needed to train proficient agents, and learns to complete tasks nearly twice as efficiently.

To mitigate this issue, we propose RoVi-Aug, which leverages state-of-the-art image-to-image generative models to augment robot data by synthesizing demonstrations with different robots and camera views. Through extensive physical experiments, we show that, by training on robot- and viewpoint-augmented data, RoVi-Aug can zero-shot deploy on a different robot with significantly different camera angles. Compared to test-time adaptation algorithms such as Mirage, RoVi-Aug requires no extra processing at test time, does not assume known camera angles, and allows policy fine-tuning. Furthermore, by co-training on original and augmented robot datasets, RoVi-Aug can learn multi-robot and multi-task policies, allowing transfer between robots and skills. In addition, we find that applying RoVi-Aug to OXE datasets improves fine-tuned policy performance by up to 30%.</td>

Our main contribution is to propose an $\mathrm{SE}(3)$-equivariant model that maps each point in the cloud to a continuous grasp quality function over the 2-sphere $S^2$ using a spherical harmonic basis. Compared with reasoning about a finite set of samples, this formulation improves the accuracy and efficiency of our model when a large number of samples would otherwise be needed. In order to accomplish this, we propose a novel variation on EquiFormerV2 that leverages a UNet-style backbone to enlarge the number of points the model can handle.

The flow generation network, trained on human demonstration videos, generates object flow from the initial scene image, conditioned on the task description. The flow-conditioned policy, trained on simulated robot play data, maps the generated object flow to robot actions to realize the desired object movements. By using flow as input, this policy can be directly deployed in the real world with a minimal sim-to-real gap. By leveraging real-world human videos and simulated robot play data, we bypass the challenges of teleoperating physical robots in the real world, resulting in a scalable system for diverse tasks.

However, the reliability of these models and consequently their safe integration onto robots remains unknown when deployed in environments unseen during training. In this work, we address this challenge by rigorously quantifying the uncertainty of pre-trained perception systems for object detection via a novel calibration technique based on conformal prediction. Crucially, this procedure guarantees robustness to distribution shifts in states when perceptual outputs are used in conjunction with a planner. As a result, the calibrated perception system can be used in combination with any safe planner to provide an end-to-end statistical assurance on safety in unseen environments. We evaluate the resulting approach, Perceive with Confidence (PwC), with experiments in simulation and on hardware where a quadruped robot navigates through previously unseen indoor, static environments.

                <td>Learning visuomotor policies for agile quadrotor flight presents significant difficulties, primarily from inefficient policy exploration caused by high-dimensional visual inputs and the need for precise and low-latency control.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that combines the performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and the sample efficiency of Imitation Learning (IL) in the task of vision-based autonomous drone racing.
While RL provides a framework for learning high-performance controllers through trial and error, it faces challenges with sample efficiency and computational demands due to the high dimensionality of visual inputs.
Conversely, IL efficiently learns from visual expert demonstrations, but it remains limited by the expert's performance and state distribution.
To overcome these limitations, our policy learning framework integrates the strengths of both approaches.
Our framework contains three phases: training a teacher policy using RL with privileged state information, distilling it into a student policy via IL, and adaptive fine-tuning via RL.
Testing in both simulated and real-world scenarios shows our approach can not only learn in scenarios where RL from scratch fails but also outperforms existing IL methods in both robustness and performance, successfully navigating a quadrotor through a race course using only visual information.</td>

Developing similar multi-modal sensing capabilities for robots can significantly enhance and expand their manipulation skills. This paper introduces **3D-ViTac**, a multi-modal sensing and learning system designed for dexterous bimanual manipulation. Our system features tactile sensors equipped with dense sensing units, each covering an area of 3$mm^2$. These sensors are low-cost and flexible, providing detailed and extensive coverage of physical contacts, effectively complementing visual information. To integrate tactile and visual data, we fuse them into a unified 3D representation space that preserves their 3D structures and spatial relationships. The multi-modal representation can then be coupled with diffusion policies for imitation learning. Through concrete hardware experiments, we demonstrate that even low-cost robots can perform precise manipulations and significantly outperform vision-only policies, particularly in safe interactions with fragile items and executing long-horizon tasks involving in-hand manipulation.

To address this challenge, we present _Dream2Assist_,  a framework that combines a rich world model able to infer human objectives and value functions, and an assistive agent that provides appropriate expert assistance to a given human teammate. Our approach builds on a recurrent state space model to explicitly infer human intents, enabling the assistive agent to select actions that align with the human and enabling a fluid teaming interaction. We demonstrate our approach in a high-speed racing domain with a population of synthetic human drivers pursuing mutually exclusive objectives, such as "stay-behind" and "overtake".

These constraints, which may represent task, safety, or actuator limitations, are essential for ensuring the proper functioning of robotic platforms and preventing unexpected behaviors. Recent advances in kinodynamic planning demonstrate that learning-to-plan techniques can generate complex and reactive motions under intricate constraints. However, these techniques necessitate the analytical modeling of both the robot and the entire task, a limiting assumption when systems are extremely complex or when constructing accurate task models is prohibitive.
This paper addresses this limitation by combining learning-to-plan methods with reinforcement learning, resulting in a novel integration of black-box learning of motion primitives and optimization. We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art safe reinforcement learning methods, showing that our technique, particularly when exploiting task structure, outperforms baseline methods in challenging scenarios such as planning to hit in robot air hockey.

Yet, widespread adoption of VLAs for robotics has been challenging as 1) existing VLAs are largely closed and inaccessible to the public, and 2) prior work fails to explore methods for efficiently fine-tuning VLAs for new tasks, a key component for adoption. Addressing these challenges, we introduce OpenVLA, a 7B-parameter open-source VLA trained on a diverse collection of 970k real-world robot demonstrations. OpenVLA builds on a Llama 2 language model combined with a visual encoder that fuses pretrained features from DINOv2 and SigLIP. As a product of the added data diversity and new model components, OpenVLA demonstrates strong results for generalist manipulation, outperforming closed models such as RT-2-X (55B) by 16.5\% in absolute task success rate across 29 tasks and multiple robot embodiments, with 7x fewer parameters. We further show that we can effectively fine-tune OpenVLA for new settings, with especially strong generalization results in multi-task environments involving multiple objects and strong language grounding abilities, where we outperform expressive from-scratch imitation learning methods such as Diffusion Policy by 19.8\%. We also explore compute efficiency; as a separate contribution, we show that OpenVLA can be fine-tuned on consumer GPUs via modern low-rank adaptation methods and served efficiently via quantization without a hit to downstream success rate. We will release model checkpoints, fine-tuning notebooks, and our PyTorch codebase with built-in support for training VLAs at scale on Open X-Embodiment datasets.</td>

In this paper, we propose the visual kinematics chain as a precise and universal representation of quasi-static actions for robot learning over diverse environments, which requires no manual adjustment since the visual kinematic chains can be automatically obtained from the robot’s model and camera parameters. We propose the Visual Kinematics Transformer (VKT), a convolution-free architecture that supports an arbitrary number of camera viewpoints, and that is trained with a single objective of forecasting kinematic structures through optimal point-set matching. We demonstrate the superior performance of VKT over BC transformers as a general agent on Calvin, RLBench, Open-X, and real robot manipulation tasks.

We demonstrate that SkillGen greatly improves data generation and policy learning performance over a state-of-the-art data generation framework, resulting in the capability produce data for large scene variations, including clutter, and agents that are on average 24% more successful.

Recent works have proposed methods in the category of autonomous IL, where an initial seed dataset of human demonstrations is bootstrapped with autonomous policy rollouts. We examine the challenges that arise when attempting to scale up this paradigm to useful tasks in the real world. Through a series of targeted real-world experiments, we find that these approaches face much of the same scaling challenges as prior work in terms of environment design. We then perform a rigorous study of various autonomous IL methods across different data scales and 7 simulation and real-world tasks; we find that autonomous data collection can modestly improve performance, but simply collecting more human data often performs much better.

Subsequently, we align the robot state resulting from the simplified model with a more precise, non-differentiable simulator to maintain sufficient simulation accuracy. Our framework enables learning quadruped walking in simulation in minutes without parallelization. When augmented with GPU parallelization, our approach allows the quadruped robot to master diverse locomotion skills on challenging terrains in minutes.

In this paper, we introduce a full-stack system for humanoids to learn motion and autonomous skills from human data. We first train a low-level policy in simulation via reinforcement learning using existing 40-hour human motion datasets. This policy transfers to the real world and allows humanoid robots to follow human body and hand motion in real time using only a RGB camera, i.e. shadowing. Through shadowing, human operators can teleoperate humanoids to collect whole-body data for learning different tasks in the real world. Using the data collected, we then perform supervised behavior cloning to train skill policies using egocentric vision, allowing humanoids to complete different tasks autonomously by imitating human skills. We demonstrate the system on our customized 33-DoF 180cm humanoid, autonomously completing tasks such as wearing a shoe to stand up and walk, folding a sweatshirt, rearranging objects, typing, and greeting another robot with 60-100% success rates using up to 40 demonstrations.</td>

Our key idea is to train agents that output actions by iterating the procedure of (i) discretizing the continuous action space into multiple intervals and (ii) selecting the interval with the highest Q-value to further discretize at the next level. We then introduce a concrete, value-based algorithm within the CRL framework called Coarse-to-fine Q-Network (CQN).

Utilizing TPV for unified scene representation and deformable attention layers for feature aggregation, our approach incorporates a backward-forward temporal attention module to capture dynamic object dependencies, followed by a 3D refine module for fine-gained volumetric representation. Besides, our method extends differentiable rendering to 3D volumetric flow fields, leveraging zero-shot 2D segmentation and optical flow cues for dynamic decomposition and motion optimization.

The task is challenging due to the need for online adaptation to varying door properties and precise control in manipulating the door panel and navigating through the confined doorway. To address this, we propose a learning-based controller for a legged manipulator to open and traverse through doors. The controller is trained using a teacher-student approach in simulation to learn robust task behaviors as well as estimate crucial door properties during the interaction. Unlike previous works, our approach is a single control policy that can handle both push and pull doors through learned behaviour which infers the opening direction during deployment without prior knowledge. The policy was deployed on the ANYmal legged robot with an arm and achieved a success rate of 95.0% in repeated trials conducted in an experimental setting. Additional experiments validate the policy's effectiveness and robustness to various doors and disturbances.

                <td>Estimating odometry, where an accumulating position and rotation is tracked, has critical applications in many areas of robotics as a form of state estimation such as in SLAM, navigation, and controls. During deployment of a legged robot, a vision system's tracking can easily get lost. Instead, using only the onboard leg and inertial sensor for odometry is a promising alternative. Previous methods in estimating leg-inertial odometry require analytical modeling or collecting high-quality real-world trajectories to train a model. Analytical modeling is specific to each robot, requires manual fine-tuning, and doesn't always capture real-world phenomena such as slippage. Previous work learning legged odometry still relies on collecting real-world data, this has been shown to not perform well out of distribution. In this work, we show that it is possible to estimate the odometry of a legged robot without any analytical modeling or real-world data collection. In this paper, we present Legolas, the first method that accurately estimates odometry in a purely data-driven fashion for quadruped robots. We deploy our method on two real-world quadruped robots in both indoor and outdoor environments. In the indoor scenes, our proposed method accomplishes a relative pose error that is 73% less than an analytical filtering-based approach and 87.5% less than a real-world behavioral cloning approach.

                <td>There are two dominating trends in today's robot grasp planners: dense-prediction and sampling-based methods. Dense-prediction methods are able to propose a collection of viable grasps across the robot's field of view, but they are limited to predicting a single grasp pose per voxel. By contrast, sampling-based methods are able to encode multi-modal grasp distributions, for instance representing that a specific point may be grasped via distinct approach vectors. Unfortunately, current sampling solutions are hindered by their reliance on a global latent representation that attempts to characterize the robot's entire field of view in a single latent representation, yielding coarse grasping solutions. This paper aims to bridge the gap between dense-prediction and sampling-based methods. We propose a novel framework named Implicit Grasp Diffusion (IGD) that leverages implicit neural representations to extract expressive local features, and that generates grasps by sampling from diffusion models conditioned on these local features. We evaluated our model on a clutter removal task in both simulated and real-world environments. The experimental results have demonstrated the high grasp accuracy, strong noise robustness, and multi-modal grasp modeling of the proposed method. The code is open-source and a GitHub link will be provided in the final version of the paper.</td>

The VLN agents with only a monocular camera exhibit extremely limited performance, while the mainstream VLN models trained with panoramic observation, perform better but are difficult to deploy on most monocular robots. For this case, we propose a sim-to-real transfer approach to endow the monocular robots with panoramic traversability perception and panoramic semantic understanding, thus smoothly transferring the high-performance panoramic VLN models to the common monocular robots. In this work, the semantic traversable map is proposed to predict agent-centric navigable waypoints, and the novel view representations of these navigable waypoints are predicted through the 3D feature fields. These methods broaden the limited field of view of the monocular robots and significantly improve navigation performance in the real world. Our VLN system outperforms previous SOTA monocular VLN methods in R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks within the simulation environments and is also validated in real-world environments, providing a practical and high-performance solution for real-world VLN.</td>

An ideal representation is expected to be 3D, dynamic, and semantic to meet the demands of diverse manipulation tasks. However, previous works often lack all three properties simultaneously. In this work, we introduce D$^3$Fields---**dynamic 3D descriptor fields**. These fields are **implicit 3D representations** that take in 3D points and output both semantic features and instance masks. They can also capture the dynamics of the underlying 3D environments. Specifically, we project arbitrary 3D points in the workspace onto multi-view 2D visual observations and interpolate features derived from visual foundational models. The resulting fused descriptor fields allow for flexible goal specifications using 2D images with varied contexts, styles, and instances. To evaluate the effectiveness of these descriptor fields, we apply our representation to rearrangement tasks in a zero-shot manner. Through extensive evaluation in both real-world scenarios and simulations, we demonstrate that D$^3$Fields are effective for **zero-shot generalizable** rearrangement tasks. We also compare D$^3$Fields with state-of-the-art implicit 3D representations and show significant improvements in effectiveness and efficiency. Project Page: https://d3fields-anon.github.io.</td>

The method is based on Bayesian meta-learning (BML), which can mitigate overfitting high-capacity visual-tactile models by meta-learning an informed prior and naturally achieves few-shot online estimation via posterior estimation.  However, BML requires a shared parametric model across tasks but visual-tactile models for diverse objects have different parameter spaces.  To address this issue, this paper introduces Structured Bayesian Meta-Learning (SBML) that incorporates heterogeneous physics models, enabling learning from training objects with varying appearances and geometries.  SBML performs zero-shot vision-only prediction of deformable model parameters, as well as few-shot adaptation after a handful of touches.  Experiments show that in two classes of heterogeneous objects, namely plants and shoes, SBML outperforms existing approaches in force and torque prediction accuracy in zero- and few-shot settings.</td>

                <td>The ability to reflect on and correct failures is crucial for robotic systems to interact stably with real-life objects. Observing the generalization and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), previous approaches have aimed to utilize these models to enhance robotic systems accordingly. However, these methods typically focus on high-level planning corrections using an additional MLLM, with limited utilization of failed samples to correct low-level contact poses.  To address this gap, we propose an Autonomous Interactive Correction (AIC) MLLM, which makes use of previous low-level interaction experiences to correct SE(3) pose predictions. Specifically, AIC MLLM is initially fine-tuned to acquire both pose prediction and feedback prompt comprehension abilities.
We carefully design two types of prompt instructions through interactions with objects: 1) visual masks to highlight unmovable parts for position correction, and 2) textual descriptions to indicate potential directions for rotation correction. During inference, a Feedback Information Extraction module is introduced to recognize the failure cause, allowing AIC MLLM to adaptively correct the pose prediction using the corresponding prompts. To further enhance manipulation stability, we devise a Test Time Adaptation strategy that enables AIC MLLM to better adapt to the current scene configuration. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted in both simulated and real-world environments to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our AIC MLLM can efficiently correct failure samples by leveraging interaction experience prompts.</td>

                <td>A key limitation of learned robot control policies is their inability to generalize outside their training data. 
Recent works on vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown that the use of large, internet pre-trained vision-language models as the backbone of learned robot policies can substantially improve their robustness and generalization ability. Yet, one of the most exciting capabilities of large vision-language models in other domains is their ability to reason iteratively through complex problems. Can that same capability be brought into robotics to allow policies to improve performance by reasoning about a given task before acting? Naive use of "chain-of-thought" (CoT) style prompting is significantly less effective with standard VLAs because of the relatively simple training examples that are available to them. Additionally, purely semantic reasoning about sub-tasks, as is common in regular CoT, is insufficient for robot policies that need to ground their reasoning in sensory observations and the robot state. To this end, we introduce Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ECoT) for VLAs, in which we train VLAs to perform multiple steps of reasoning about plans, sub-tasks, motions, and visually grounded features like object bounding boxes and end effector positions, before predicting the robot action. We design a scalable pipeline for generating synthetic training data for ECoT on large robot datasets. We demonstrate, that ECoT increases the absolute success rate of OpenVLA, the current strongest open-source VLA policy, by 28\% across challenging generalization tasks, without any additional robot training data. Additionally, ECoT makes it easier for humans to interpret a policy's failures and correct its behavior using natural language.</td>

                <td>Legged robot locomotion on sand slopes is challenging due to the complex dynamics of granular media and how the lack of solid surfaces can hinder locomotion. A promising strategy, inspired by ghost crabs and other organisms in nature, is to strategically interact with rocks, debris, and other obstacles to facilitate movement. To provide legged robots with this ability, we present a novel approach that leverages avalanche dynamics to indirectly manipulate objects on a granular slope. We use a Vision Transformer (ViT) to process image representations of granular dynamics and robot excavation actions. The ViT predicts object movement, which we use to determine which leg excavation action to execute. We collect training data from 100 real physical trials and, at test time, deploy our trained model in novel settings. Experimental results suggest that our model can accurately predict object movements and achieve a success rate ≥ 80% in a variety of manipulation tasks with up to four obstacles, and can also generalize to objects with different physics properties. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to leverage granular media avalanche dynamics to indirectly manipulate objects on granular slopes.

We propose Contrastive $\lambda$-Repformer, which predicts task success for table-top manipulation tasks by aligning images with instruction sentences. Our method integrates the following three key types of features into a multi-level aligned representation: features that preserve local image information; features aligned with natural language; and features structured through natural language. This allows the model to focus on important changes by looking at the differences in the representation between two images. We evaluate Contrastive $\lambda$-Repformer on a dataset based on a large-scale standard dataset, the RT-1 dataset, and on a physical robot platform. The results show that our approach outperformed existing approaches including MLLMs. Our best model achieved an improvement of 13.52 points in accuracy compared to the representative MLLM-based models.</td>

Central to the design of SGRv2 is the incorporation of a critical inductive bias—$\textit{action locality}$, which posits that robot's actions are predominantly influenced by the target object and its interactions with the local environment. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that action locality is essential for boosting sample efficiency. SGRv2 excels in RLBench tasks with keyframe control using merely 5 demonstrations and surpasses the RVT baseline in 23 of 26 tasks. Furthermore, when evaluated on ManiSkill2 and MimicGen using dense control, SGRv2's success rate is 2.54 times that of SGR. In real-world environments, with only eight demonstrations, SGRv2 can perform a variety of tasks at a markedly higher success rate compared to baseline models.</td>

To address this limitation, we propose ProFusion3D, a progressive fusion framework that combines features in both BEV and PV at both intermediate and object query levels. Our architecture hierarchically fuses local and global features, enhancing the robustness of 3D object detection. Additionally, we introduce a self-supervised mask modeling pre-training strategy to improve multi-modal representation learning and data efficiency through three novel objectives. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets conclusively demonstrate the efficacy of ProFusion3D. Moreover, ProFusion3D is robust to sensor failure, showing strong performance when only one modality is available.</td>

An open-world grasping system should be able to combine high-level contextual with low-level physical-geometric reasoning in order to be applicable in arbitrary scenarios.
Recent works exploit the web-scale knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs) to plan and reason in robotic context, but rely on external vision and action models to ground such knowledge into the environment and parameterize actuation.
This setup suffers from two major bottlenecks: a) the LLM's reasoning capacity is constrained by the quality of visual grounding, and b) LLMs do not contain low-level spatial understanding of the world, which is essential for grasping in contact-rich scenarios.
In this work we demonstrate that modern vision-language models (VLMs) are capable of tackling such limitations, as they are implicitly grounded and can jointly reason about semantics and geometry. 
We propose \texttt{OWG}, an open-world grasping pipeline that combines VLMs with segmentation and grasp synthesis models to unlock grounded world understanding in three stages: open-ended referring segmentation, grounded grasp planning and grasp ranking via contact reasoning, all of which can be applied zero-shot via suitable visual prompting mechanisms.
We conduct extensive evaluation in cluttered indoor scene datasets to showcase \texttt{OWG}'s robustness in grounding from open-ended language, as well as open-world robotic grasping experiments in both simulation and hardware that demonstrate superior performance compared to previous supervised and zero-shot LLM-based methods.</td>

Given the lack of sufficient data for this task, we build PaperCutting-Sim, a paper simulator supporting interactive fracture coupling with scissors, enabling demonstration generation with a heuristic-based oracle policy. 
To ensure effective execution, we customize an action primitive sequence for imitation learning to constrain its action space, thus alleviating potential compounding errors.
Finally, by integrating sim-to-real techniques to bridge the gap between simulation and reality, our policy can be effectively deployed on the real robot.

                <td>Many approaches to robot learning begin by inferring a reward function from a set of human demonstrations.
To learn a good reward, it is necessary to determine which features of the environment are relevant before determining how these features should be used to compute reward.
In particularly complex, high-dimensional environments, human demonstrators often struggle to fully specify their desired behavior from a small number of demonstrations.
End-to-end reward learning methods (e.g., using deep networks or program synthesis techniques) often yield brittle reward functions that are sensitive to spurious state features.
By contrast, humans can often generalizably learn from a small number of demonstrations by incorporating strong priors about what features of a demonstration are likely meaningful for a task of interest. 
How do we build robots that leverage this kind of background knowledge when learning from new demonstrations?
This paper describes a method named ALGAE which alternates between using language models to iteratively identify human-meaningful features needed to explain demonstrated behavior, then standard inverse reinforcement learning techniques to assign weights to these features.
Experiments across a variety of both simulated and real-world robot environments show that ALGAElearns generalizable reward functions defined on interpretable features using only small numbers of demonstrations.
Importantly, ALGAE can recognize when features are missing, then extract and define those features without any human input -- making it possible to quickly and efficiently acquire rich representations of user behavior.</td>

                <td>Legged navigation is typically examined within open-world, off-road, and challenging environments. In these scenarios, estimating external disturbances requires a complex synthesis of multi-modal information. This underlines a major limitation in existing works that primarily focus on avoiding obstacles. In this work, we propose TOP-Nav, a novel legged navigation framework that integrates a comprehensive path planner with Terrain awareness, Obstacle avoidance and close-loop Proprioception. TOP-Nav underscores the synergies between vision and proprioception in both path and motion planning. Within the path planner, we present a terrain estimator that enables the robot to select waypoints on terrains with higher traversability while effectively avoiding obstacles. In the motion planning level, we construct a proprioception advisor from the learning-based locomotion controller to provide motion evaluations for the path planner. Based on the close-loop motion feedback, we offer online corrections for the vision-based terrain and obstacle estimations. Consequently, TOP-Nav achieves open-world navigation that the robot can handle terrains or disturbances beyond the distribution of prior knowledge and overcomes constraints imposed by visual conditions. Building upon extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments, TOP-Nav demonstrates superior performance in open-world navigation compared to existing methods.</td>

We approach this problem from the lens of Koopman theory and learn visual representations from robotic agents conditioned on specific downstream tasks in the context of learning stabilizing control for the agent. We introduce a Contrastive Spectral Koopman Embedding network that allows us to learn efficient linearized visual representations from the agent's visual data in a high dimensional latent space and utilizes reinforcement learning to perform off-policy control on top of the extracted representations with a linear controller. Our method enhances stability and control in gradient dynamics over time, significantly outperforming existing approaches by improving efficiency and accuracy in learning task policies over extended horizons.</td>

To address these limitations, we present a new scalable approach to multi-agent control in this setting. Our method treats the relationships between agents using a graph structure rather than in terms of a single-agent perspective. Moreover, it combines a multi-agent collision avoidance controller with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based planner, models the system in a decentralized fashion, and trains on STL-based objectives to generate safe and efficient plans for multiple agents, thereby optimizing the satisfaction of complex temporal specifications while also facilitating multi-agent collision avoidance. Our experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods that use a state-of-the-art MILP-based planner in terms of scalability and performance.</td>

Moreover, collecting the data to train such an SA model is challenging: 
being an internal human cognitive state, driver SA is difficult to measure, and non-verbal signals such as eye gaze are some of the only outward manifestations of it. Traditional methods to obtain SA labels rely on probes that result in sparse, intermittent SA labels unsuitable for modeling a dense, temporally correlated process via machine learning. We propose a novel interactive labeling protocol that captures dense, continuous SA labels and use it to collect an object-level SA dataset in a VR driving simulator. Our dataset comprises 20 unique drivers' SA labels, driving data, and gaze (over 320 minutes of driving) which will be made public.
Additionally, we train an SA model from this data, formulating the object-level driver SA prediction problem as a semantic segmentation problem. Our formulation allows all objects in a scene at a timestep to be processed simultaneously, leveraging global scene context and local gaze-object relationships together.
Our experiments show that this formulation leads to improved performance over common sense baselines and prior art on the SA prediction task.</td>

In this work, we take an alternative approach and propose CtRL-Sim, a method that leverages return-conditioned offline reinforcement learning to efficiently generate reactive and controllable traffic agents. Specifically, we process real-world driving data through a physics-enhanced Nocturne simulator to generate a diverse offline reinforcement learning dataset, annotated with various reward terms. We then train a return-conditioned multi-agent behaviour model that allows for fine-grained manipulation of agent behaviours by modifying the desired returns for the various reward components. This capability enables the generation of a wide range of driving behaviours beyond the scope of the initial dataset, including adversarial behaviours. We demonstrate that CtRL-Sim can generate diverse and realistic safety-critical scenarios while providing fine-grained control over agent behaviours.</td>

We identify control and visual disparities between real and simulated environments as key challenges for reliable simulated evaluation and propose approaches for mitigating these gaps without needing to painstakingly craft full-fidelity digital twins. We then employ these techniques to create SIMPLER, a collection of simulated environments for policy evaluation on common real robot manipulation setups. Through over 1500 paired sim-and-real evaluations of manipulation policies across two embodiments and eight task families, we demonstrate strong correlation between policy performance in SIMPLER environments and that in the real world. Beyond aggregated trends, we find that SIMPLER evaluations effectively reflect the real-world behaviors of individual policies, such as sensitivity to various distribution shifts.

                <td>Despite the impressive recent advances in learning-based robot control, ensuring robustness to out-of-distribution conditions remains an open challenge. Safety filters can, in principle, keep arbitrary control policies from incurring catastrophic failures by overriding unsafe actions, but existing solutions for complex (e.g., legged) robot dynamics do not span the full motion envelope and instead rely on local, reduced-order models. These filters tend to overly restrict agility and can still fail when perturbed away from nominal conditions. This paper presents the gameplay filter, a new class of predictive safety filter that continually plays out hypothetical matches between its simulation-trained safety strategy and a virtual adversary co-trained to invoke worst-case events and sim-to-real error, and precludes actions that would cause it to fail down the line. We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the approach on with a first-of-its-kind full-order safety filter for (36-D) quadrupedal dynamics. Physical experiments on two different quadruped platforms demonstrate the superior zero-shot effectiveness of the gameplay filter under large perturbations such as tugging and unmodeled terrain.</td>

Human-friendly natural language has been explored for tasks such as driving explanation and 3D captioning. However, previous works primarily focused on the paradigm of declarative interpretability, where the natural language interpretations are not grounded in the intermediate outputs of AD systems, making the interpretations only declarative. In contrast, aligned interpretability establishes a connection between language and the intermediate outputs of AD systems. Here we introduce Hint-AD, an integrated AD-language system that generates language aligned with the holistic perception-prediction-planning outputs of the AD model. By incorporating the intermediate outputs and a holistic token mixer sub-network for effective feature adaptation, Hint-AD achieves desirable accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results in driving language tasks including driving explanation, 3D dense captioning, and command prediction. To facilitate further study on driving explanation task on nuScenes, we also introduce a human-labeled dataset, Nu-X.

T3 captures the shared latent information across different sensor-task pairings by constructing a shared trunk transformer with sensor-specific encoders and task-specific decoders. The pre-training of T3utilizes a novel Foundation Tactile (FoTa) dataset, which is aggregated from several open-sourced datasets and it contains over 3 million data points gathered from 13 sensors and 11 tasks. FoTa is the largest and most diverse dataset in tactile sensing to date and it is made publicly available in a unified format. Across various sensors and tasks, experiments show that T3 pre-trained with FoTa achieved zero-shot transferability in certain sensor-task pairings, can be further fine-tuned with small amounts of domain-specific data, and its performance scales with bigger network sizes. T3 is also effective as a tactile encoder for long horizon contact-rich manipulation. Results from sub-millimeter multi-pin electronics insertion tasks show that T3 achieved a task success rate 25% higher than that of policies trained with tactile encoders trained from scratch, or 53% higher than without tactile sensing.

Systems composed of multiple concurrently operating robots additionally require access to frequent, accurate and reliable pose estimates. Classical vision-based methods to regress relative pose are commonly computationally expensive (precluding real-time applications), and often lack data-derived priors for resolving ambiguities. In this work, we propose CoViS-Net, a cooperative, multi-robot visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data, enabling pose estimation as well as general spatial comprehension. Our model is fully decentralized, platform-agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute, and does not require existing networking infrastructure. CoViS-Net provides relative pose estimates and a local bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation, even without camera overlap between robots, and can predict BEV representations of unseen regions. We demonstrate its use in a multi-robot formation control task across various real-world settings. We provide supplementary material online and will open source our trained model in due course.

Human hand motions demonstrate proficient manipulation capability, providing valuable data for training robots with multi-finger hands. Despite this potential, substantial challenges arise due to the embodiment gap between human and robot hands. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical policy learning framework that uses human hand motion data for training object-centric dexterous robot manipulation. At the core of our method is a high-level trajectory generative model, learned with a large-scale human hand motion capture dataset, to synthesize human-like wrist motions conditioned on the desired object goal states. Guided by the generated wrist motions, deep reinforcement learning is further used to train a low-level finger controller that is grounded in the robot's embodiment to physically interact with the object to achieve the goal. Through extensive evaluation across 10 household objects, our approach not only demonstrates superior performance but also showcases generalization capability to novel object geometries and goal states. Furthermore, we transfer the learned policies from simulation to a real-world bimanual dexterous robot system, further demonstrating its applicability in real-world scenarios.

                <td>Online Imitation Learning methods struggle with the gap between extensive online exploration space and limited expert trajectories, which hinder efficient exploration due to inaccurate task-aware reward estimation.
    Inspired by the findings from cognitive neuroscience that task decomposition could facilitate cognitive processing for efficient learning, we hypothesize that an agent could estimate precise task-aware imitation rewards for efficient online exploration by decomposing the target task into the objectives of "what to do" and the mechanisms of "how to do".
    In this work, we introduce the hybrid Key-state guided Online Imitation (KOI) learning approach, which leverages the integration of semantic and motion key states as guidance for task-aware reward estimation.
    Initially, we utilize the visual-language models to segment the expert trajectory into semantic key states, indicating the objectives of "what to do". 
    Within the intervals between semantic key states, optical flow is employed to capture motion key states to understand the process of "how to do".
    By integrating a thorough grasp of both semantic and motion key states, we refine the trajectory-matching reward computation, encouraging task-aware exploration for efficient online imitation learning.
    Our experiment results prove that our method is more sample efficient than previous state-of-the-art approaches in the Meta-World and LIBERO environments. We also conduct real-world robotic manipulation experiments to validate the efficacy of our method, demonstrating the practical applicability of our KOI method.</td>

To achieve this, we study a widely useful category of navigation tasks we call Multimodal Instruction Navigation with demonstration Tours (MINT), in which the environment prior is provided through a previously recorded demonstration video. Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown a promising path in achieving this goal as it demonstrates capabilities in perceiving and reasoning about multimodal inputs. However, VLMs are typically trained to predict textual output and it is an open research question about how to best utilize them in navigation. To solve MINT, we present Mobility VLA, a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) navigation policy that combines the environment understanding and common sense reasoning power of long-context VLMs and a robust low-level navigation policy based on topological graphs. The high-level policy consists of a long-context VLM that takes the demonstration tour video and the multimodal user instruction as input to find the goal frame in the tour video. Next, a low-level policy uses the goal frame and an offline constructed topological graph to generate robot actions at every timestep. We evaluated Mobility VLA in a 836$m^2$ real world environment and show that Mobility VLA has a high end-to-end success rates on previously unsolved multimodal instructions such as ``Where should I return this?'' while holding a plastic bin.</td>

However, their high performance comes with the drawback of large models that complicate effective training. While state space models (SSMs) have been known for their efficiency, they were not able to match the performance of Transformers. Mamba significantly improves the performance of SSMs and rivals against Transformers, positioning it as an appealing alternative for IL policies. MaIL leverages Mamba as a backbone and introduces a formalism that allows using Mamba in the encoder-decoder structure. This formalism makes it a versatile architecture that can be used as a standalone policy or as part of a more advanced architecture, such as a diffuser in the diffusion process. Extensive evaluations on the LIBERO IL benchmark and three real robot experiments show that MaIL: i) outperforms Transformers in all LIBERO tasks, ii) achieves good performance even with small datasets, iii) is able to effectively process multi-modal sensory inputs, iv) is more robust to input noise compared to Transformers.</td>

This information constrains and accelerates bandit-like policy selection, affording quick selection of the best-performing strategy shortly after it would start to yield good performance.

The propagated region masks are transformed into bounding boxes through a learnable spatial integral layer. Instead of training prototype classifiers, we propose to use prototypes to project ViT features into a subspace that is robust to overfitting on base classes. We evaluate DE-ViT on few-shot, and one-shot object detection benchmarks with Pascal VOC, COCO, and LVIS. DE-ViT establishes new state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.

Further, we evaluate DE-ViT with a real robot by building a pick-and-place system for sorting novel objects based on example images.

The choice can substantially impact final performance even when choosing among configuration-space representations such as joint position, velocity, and torque commands. We examine action space selection considering a wheeled-legged robot, a quadruped robot, and a simulated suite of locomotion, manipulation, and control tasks. 
We analyze the mechanisms by which action space can improve performance and conclude that the action space can influence learning performance substantially in a task-dependent way. Moreover, we find that much of the practical impact of action space selection on learning dynamics can be explained by improved policy initialization and behavior between timesteps.</td>

                <td>Robot decision-making increasingly relies on data-driven human prediction models when operating around people. While these models are known to mispredict in out-of-distribution interactions, only a subset of prediction errors impact downstream robot performance.  
We propose characterizing such ``system-level'' prediction failures via the mathematical notion of regret: high-regret interactions are precisely those in which mispredictions degraded closed-loop robot performance. 
We further introduce a probabilistic generalization of regret that calibrates failure detection across disparate deployment contexts and renders regret compatible with reward-based and reward-free (e.g., generative) planners.  
In simulated autonomous driving interactions, we showcase that our system-level failure metric can automatically mine for closed-loop human-robot interactions that state-of-the-art generative human predictors and robot planners struggle with. 
We further find that the very presence of high-regret data during human predictor fine-tuning is highly predictive of robot re-deployment performance improvements. 
Furthermore, fine-tuning with the informative but significantly smaller high-regret data (23% of deployment data) is competitive with fine-tuning on the full deployment dataset, indicating a promising avenue for efficiently mitigating system-level human-robot interaction failures.</td>

However, most results focus on table-top manipulation, lacking the mobility and dexterity necessary for generally useful tasks. In this work, we develop a system for imitating mobile manipulation tasks that are bimanual and require whole-body control. We first present Mobile ALOHA, a low-cost and whole-body teleoperation system for data collection. It augments the ALOHA system with a mobile base, and a whole-body teleoperation interface. Using data collected with Mobile ALOHA, we then perform supervised behavior cloning and find that co-training with existing static ALOHA datasets boosts performance on mobile manipulation tasks. With 50 demonstrations for each task, co-training can increase success rates by up to 90\%, allowing Mobile ALOHA to autonomously complete complex mobile manipulation tasks such as sauteing and serving a piece of shrimp, opening a two-door wall cabinet to store heavy cooking pots, calling and entering an elevator, and lightly rinsing a used pan using a kitchen faucet.  We will open-source all the hardware and software implementations upon publication.</td>

                <td>Imitation learning policies in robotics tend to require an extensive amount of demonstrations. It is critical to develop few-shot adaptation strategies that rely only on a small amount of task-specific human demonstrations. Prior works focus on learning general policies from large scale dataset with diverse behaviors. Recent research has shown that directly retrieving relevant past experiences to augment policy learning has great promise in few-shot settings. However, existing data retrieval methods fall under two extremes: they either rely on the existence of exact same behaviors with visually similar scenes in the prior data, which is impractical to assume; or they retrieve based on semantic similarity of high-level language descriptions of the task, which might not be that informative about the shared behaviors or motions across tasks. In this work, we investigate how we can leverage motion similarity in the vast amount of cross-task data to improve few-shot imitation learning of the target task. Our key insight is that motion-similar data carry rich information about the effects of actions and object interactions that can be leveraged during few-shot adaptation. We propose FlowRetrieval, an approach that leverages optical flow representations for both extracting similar motions to target tasks from prior data, and for guiding learning of a policy that can maximally benefit from such data. Our results show FlowRetrieval significantly outperforms prior methods across simulated and real-world domains, achieving on average 27% higher success rate than the best retrieval-based prior method. In the Pen-in-Cup task with a real Franka Emika robot, FlowRetrieval achieves 3.7x the performance of the baseline learning from all prior and target data.</td>

However, developing an effective curriculum of environment distributions currently requires significant expertise, which must be repeated for every new domain. Our key insight is that environments are often naturally represented as code. Thus, we probe whether effective environment curriculum design can be achieved and automated via code generation by large language models (LLM). In this paper, we introduce Eurekaverse, an unsupervised environment design algorithm that uses LLMs to sample progressively more challenging, diverse, and learnable environments for skill training. We validate Eurekaverse's effectiveness in the domain of quadrupedal parkour learning, in which a quadruped robot must traverse through a variety of obstacle courses. The automatic curriculum designed by Eurekaverse enables gradual learning of complex parkour skills in simulation and can successfully transfer to the real-world, outperforming manual training courses designed by humans.</td>

    By exploiting the exceptional temporal resolution of event cameras, Event3GDS can reconstruct high-fidelity 3D structure and appearance under high-speed egomotion. 
    Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Event3DGS compared with existing event-based dense 3D scene reconstruction frameworks; Event3DGS substantially improves reconstruction quality (+3dB) while reducing computational costs by 95\%.

                <td>For everyday service robotics, the ability to navigate back and forth based on tasks in multi-subscene environments and perform delicate manipulations is crucial and highly practical.
While existing robotics primarily focus on complex tasks within a single scene or simple tasks across scalable scenes individually, robots consisting of a mobile base with a robotic arm face the challenge of efficiently representing multiple subscenes, coordinating the collaboration between the mobile base and the robotic arm, and managing delicate tasks in scalable environments.
To address this issue, we propose Target-driven Multi-subscene Mobile Manipulation (\textit{TaMMa}), which efficiently handles mobile base movement and fine-grained manipulation across subscenes. Specifically, we obtain a reliable 3D Gaussian initialization of the whole scene using a sparse 3D point cloud with encoded semantics. Through querying the coarse Gaussians, we acquire the approximate pose of the target, navigate the mobile base to approach it, and reduce the scope of precise target pose estimation to the corresponding subscene. Optimizing while moving, we employ diffusion-based depth completion to optimize fine-grained Gaussians and estimate the target's refined pose. For target-driven manipulation, we adopt Gaussians inpainting to obtain precise poses for the origin and destination of the operation in a \textit{think before you do it} manner, enabling fine-grained manipulation. 
We conduct various experiments on a real robotic to demonstrate our method in effectively and efficiently achieving precise operation tasks across multiple tabletop subscenes.</td>

                <td>Lidar-based perception pipelines rely on 3D object detection models to interpret complex scenes. While multiple representations for lidar exist, the range-view is enticing since it losslessly encodes the entire lidar sensor output. In this work, we achieve state-of-the-art amongst range-view 3D object detection models without using multiple techniques proposed in past range-view literature. We explore range-view 3D object detection across two modern datasets with substantially different properties: Argoverse 2 and Waymo Open. Our investigation reveals key insights: (1) input feature dimensionality significantly influences the overall performance, (2) surprisingly, employing a classification loss grounded in 3D spatial proximity works as well or better compared to more elaborate IoU-based losses, and (3) addressing non-uniform lidar density via a straightforward range subsampling technique outperforms existing multi-resolution, range-conditioned networks. Our experiments reveal that techniques proposed in recent range-view literature are not needed to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Combining the above findings, we establish a new state-of-the-art model for range-view 3D object detection --- improving AP by 2.2% on the Waymo Open dataset while maintaining a runtime of 10 Hz. We establish the first range-view model on the Argoverse 2 dataset and outperform strong voxel-based baselines. All models are multi-class and open-source.

NILS combines pre-trained vision-language foundation models in a sophisticated, carefully considered manner in order to detect objects in a scene, detect object-centric changes, segment tasks from

The visual manipulation policy module decides how the leg should interact with the object, trained with reinforcement learning (RL) with point cloud observations and object-centric actions. The loco-manipulator controller controls the leg movements and body pose adjustments, implemented based on impedance control and Model Predictive Control (MPC). Besides manipulating objects with a single leg, the proposed system can also select from left or right legs based on the critic maps and move the object to distant goals through robot base adjustment.

We then generate experience from this privileged policy to warm-start a sample efficient off-policy RL algorithm from depth images.
This allows the robot to adapt behaviors from this privileged experience to visual locomotion while circumventing the high computational costs of RL directly from pixels.

                <td>Humanoid activities involving sequential contacts are crucial for complex robotic interactions and operations in the real world and are traditionally solved by model-based motion planning, which is time-consuming and often relies on simplified dynamics models. 
Although model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for versatile and robust whole-body humanoid control, 
it still requires tedious task-specific tuning and state machine design and suffers from long-horizon exploration issues in tasks involving contact sequences. In this work, we propose WoCoCo (Whole-Body Control with Sequential Contacts), a unified framework to learn whole-body humanoid control with sequential contacts by naturally decomposing the tasks into separate contact stages. Such decomposition facilitates simple and general policy learning pipelines through task-agnostic reward and sim-to-real designs, requiring only one or two task-related terms to be specified for each task. We demonstrated that end-to-end RL-based controllers trained with WoCoCo enable four challenging whole-body humanoid tasks involving diverse contact sequences in the real world without any motion priors: 1) versatile parkour jumping, 2) box loco-manipulation, 3) dynamic clap-and-tap dancing, and 4) cliffside climbing. We further show that WoCoCo is a general framework beyond humanoid by applying it in 22-DoF dinosaur robot loco-manipulation tasks. Website: lecar-lab.github.io/wococo/.</td>

                <td>In vision-based behaviour cloning (BC), traditional image-level augmentation methods such as pixel shifting enhance in-domain performance but often struggle with visual domain shifts, including distractors, occlusion, and changes in lighting and backgrounds. Conversely, superimposition-based augmentation, proven effective in computer vision, improves model generalisability by blending training images and out-of-domain images. Despite its potential, the applicability of these methods to vision-based BC remains unclear due to the unique challenges posed by BC demonstrations; specifically, preserving task-critical scene semantics, spatial-temporal relationships, and agent-target interactions is crucial. To address this, we introduce RoboSaGA, a context-aware approach that dynamically adjusts augmentation intensity per pixel based on input saliency derived from the policy. This method ensures aggressive augmentation within task-trivial areas without compromising task-critical information. Furthermore, RoboSaGA seamlessly integrates into existing network architectures without the need for structural changes or additional learning objectives. Our empirical evaluations across both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that RoboSaGA not only maintains in-domain performance but significantly improves resilience to distractors and background variations.</td>

In contrast to single-arm manipulation, bimanual manipulation tasks are challenging due to higher-dimensional action spaces. Prior works leverage large amounts of data and primitive actions to address this problem, but may suffer from sample inefficiency and limited generalization across various tasks. To this end, we propose VoxAct-B, a language-conditioned, voxel-based method that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to prioritize key regions within the scene and reconstruct a voxel grid. We provide this voxel grid to our bimanual manipulation policy to learn acting and stabilizing actions. This approach enables more efficient policy learning from voxels and is generalizable to different tasks. In simulation, we show that VoxAct-B outperforms strong baselines on fine-grained bimanual manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate VoxAct-B on real-world $\texttt{Open Drawer}$ and $\texttt{Open Jar}$ tasks using two UR5s. Code, data, and videos will be available at https://voxact-b.github.io.</td>

                <td>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently achieved remarkable success in robotic control. However, most works in RL operate in simulated environments where privileged knowledge (e.g., dynamics, surroundings, terrains) is readily available. Conversely, in real-world scenarios, robot agents usually rely solely on local states (e.g., proprioceptive feedback of robot joints) to select actions, leading to a significant sim-to-real gap. Existing methods address this gap by either gradually reducing the reliance on privileged knowledge or performing a two-stage policy imitation. However, we argue that these methods are limited in their ability to fully leverage the available privileged knowledge, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we formulate the sim-to-real gap as an information bottleneck problem and therefore propose a novel privileged knowledge distillation method called the Historical Information Bottleneck (HIB). In particular, HIB learns a privileged knowledge representation from historical trajectories by capturing the underlying changeable dynamic information. Theoretical analysis shows that the learned privileged knowledge representation helps reduce the value discrepancy between the oracle and learned policies. Empirical experiments on both simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that HIB yields improved generalizability compared to previous methods.</td>

One such setting is collision-free motion optimization for robot manipulation, where optimization converges quickly on easy problems but struggle in obstacle dense environments (e.g., a cluttered cabinet or table). In these situations, graph based planning algorithms are called to obtain seeds, resulting significant slowdowns. We propose DiffusionSeeder, a diffusion based approach that generates trajectories to seed motion optimization for rapid robot motion planning. DiffusionSeeder takes the initial depth image observation of the scene and generates high quality, multi-modal trajectories that are then fine-tuned with few iterations of motion optimization. We integrated DiffusionSeeder with cuRobo, a GPU-accelerated motion optimization method, to generate the seed trajectories which results in 12x speed up on average, and 36x speed up for more complicated problems, while achieving 10% higher success rate in partially observed simulation environments. Our results prove the effectiveness of using diverse solutions from learned diffusion model. Physical experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate the sim2real transfer of DiffusionSeeder to the real robot, with an average success rate of 86% and planning time of 26ms, increasing on cuRobo by 51% higher success rate and 2.5x speed up.

                <td>Many robot manipulation tasks require active or interactive exploration behavior in order to be performed successfully.

We identify these tasks with a new type of problem, factorized Contextual Markov Decision Processes, and propose DISaM, a dual-policy solution composed of an information-seeking policy that explores the environment to find the relevant contextual information and an information-receiving policy that exploits the context to achieve the manipulation goal. This factorization allows us to train both policies separately, using the information-receiving one to provide reward to train the information-seeking policy. At test time, the dual agent balances exploration and exploitation based on the uncertainty the manipulation policy has on what the next best action is. We demonstrate the capabilities of our dual policy solution in five manipulation tasks that require information-seeking behaviors, both in simulation and in the real-world, where DISaM significantly outperforms existing methods.

However, training a single policy on multi-robot data is challenging because robots can have widely varying sensors, actuators, and control frequencies. We propose CrossFormer, a scalable and flexible transformer-based policy that can consume data from any embodiment. We train CrossFormer on the largest and most diverse dataset to date, 900K trajectories across 30 different robot embodiments. We demonstrate that the same network weights can control vastly different robots, including single and dual arm manipulation systems, wheeled robots, quadcopters, and quadrupeds.

Such failures can lead to catastrophic outcomes, including damage to the robot from unexpected robot behaviors such as falling during walking. Previous work has tried to address this problem by recovering missing sensor values from the history of states or by adapting learned control policies to handle corrupted sensors through fine-tuning during deployment.
In this work, we propose training reinforcement learning (RL) policies that are robust to sensory failures. We use a multimodal encoder designed to account for these failures and a training strategy that randomly drops a subset of sensor modalities, similar to missing observations caused by failed sensors. We conduct evaluations across multiple tasks (bipedal locomotion and robotic manipulation) with varying robot embodiments in both simulation and the real world to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that the proposed method produces robust RL policies that handle failures in both low-dimensional proprioceptive and high-dimensional visual modalities without a significant increase in training time or decrease in sample efficiency, making it a promising solution for learning RL policies robust to sensory failures.</td>

While distilled feature fields from large vision models have enabled semantic correspondences across 3D scenes, their features are point-based and restricted to object surfaces, limiting their capability of modeling complex semantic feature distributions for hand-object interactions. In this work, we propose the *neural attention field* for representing semantic-aware dense feature fields in the 3D space by modeling inter-point relevance instead of individual point features. Core to it is a transformer decoder that computes the cross-attention between any 3D query point with all the scene points, and provides the query point feature with an attention-based aggregation. We further propose a self-supervised framework for training the transformer decoder from only a few 3D pointclouds without hand demonstrations. Post-training, the attention field can be applied to novel scenes for semantics-aware dexterous grasping from one-shot demonstration. Experiments show that our method provides better optimization landscapes by encouraging the end-effector to focus on task-relevant scene regions, resulting in significant improvements in success rates on real robots compared with the feature-field-based methods.</td>

Our representation comprises particles that capture the geometrical aspect of objects in the world and can be used alongside a particle-based physics system to anticipate physically plausible future states. Attached to these particles are 3D Gaussians that render images from any viewpoint through a splatting process thus capturing the visual state. By comparing the predicted and observed images, our approach generates "visual forces" that correct the particle positions while respecting known physical constraints. By integrating predictive physical modeling with continuous visually-derived corrections, our unified representation reasons about the present and future while synchronizing with reality.

Koopman operators have emerged as a robust method for modeling such nonlinear dynamics within a linear framework.
However, current methods rely on runtime access to ground-truth (GT) object states, making them unsuitable for vision-based practical applications.
Unlike image-to-action policies that implicitly learn visual features for control, we use a dynamics model, specifically the Koopman operator, to learn visually interpretable object features critical for robotic manipulation within a scene.
We construct a Koopman operator using object features predicted by a feature extractor and utilize it to auto-regressively advance system states. We train the feature extractor to embed scene information into object features, thereby enabling the accurate propagation of robot trajectories.
We evaluate our approach on simulated and real-world robot tasks, with results showing that it outperformed the model-based imitation learning NDP by 1.08$\times$ and the image-to-action Diffusion Policy by 1.16$\times$. The results suggest that our method maintains task success rates with learned features and extends applicability to real-world manipulation without GT object states.

                <td>Inspired by the success of transfer learning in computer vision, roboticists have investigated visual pre-training as a means to improve the learning efficiency and generalization ability of policies learned from pixels. To that end, past work has favored large object interaction datasets, such as first-person videos of humans completing diverse tasks, in pursuit of manipulation-relevant features. Although this approach improves the efficiency of policy learning, it remains unclear how reliable these representations are in the presence of distribution shifts that arise commonly in robotic applications. Surprisingly, we find that visual representations designed for control tasks do not necessarily generalize under subtle changes in lighting and scene texture or the introduction of distractor objects. To understand what properties _do_ lead to robust representations, we compare the performance of 15 pre-trained vision models under different visual appearances. We find that emergent segmentation ability is a strong predictor of out-of-distribution generalization among ViT models. The rank order induced by this metric is more predictive than metrics that have previously guided generalization research within computer vision and machine learning, such as downstream ImageNet accuracy, in-domain accuracy, or shape-bias as evaluated by cue-conflict performance. We test this finding extensively on a suite of distribution shifts in ten tasks across two simulated manipulation environments. On the ALOHA setup, segmentation score predicts real-world performance after offline training with 50 demonstrations.</td>

Fortunately, in many cases, learning can be done in an asymmetric setting where states are available during training but not during execution. Prior studies often leverage the state to indirectly influence the training of a history-based actor (actor-critic methods) or a history-based critic (value-based methods). Instead, we propose using state-observation and state-history mutual information to improve the agent's architecture and ability to seek information and memorize efficiently through intrinsic rewards and an auxiliary task. Our method outperforms strong baselines through extensive experiments and achieves successful sim-to-real transfers to a real robot.</td>

However, it remains unclear how to formulate the constraints such that they are 1) versatile to diverse tasks, 2) free of manual labeling, and 3) optimizable by off-the-shelf solvers to produce robot actions in real-time. In this work, we introduce Relational Keypoint Constraints (ReKep), a visually-grounded representation for constraints in robotic manipulation. Specifically, ReKep are expressed as Python functions mapping a set of 3D keypoints in the environment to a numerical cost. We demonstrate that by representing a manipulation task as a sequence of Relational Keypoint Constraints, we can employ a hierarchical optimization procedure to solve for robot actions (represented by a sequence of end-effector poses in SE(3)) with a perception-action loop at a real-time frequency. Furthermore, in order to circumvent the need for manual specification of ReKep for each new task, we devise an automated procedure that leverages large vision models and vision-language models to produce ReKep from free-form language instructions and RGB-D observation. We present system implementations on a mobile single-arm platform and a stationary dual-arm platform that can perform a large variety of manipulation tasks, featuring multi-stage, in-the-wild, bimanual, and reactive behaviors, all without task-specific data or environment models.</td>

This data is predominantly collected under human supervision, particularly through imitation learning (IL), where robots learn complex tasks by observing human supervisors. However, the deployment of multiple robots and supervisors to accelerate the learning process often leads to data redundancy and inefficiencies, especially as the scale of robot fleets increases. Moreover, the reliance on teleoperation for supervision introduces additional challenges due to potential network connectivity issues. 
To address these inefficiencies and the reliability concerns of network-dependent supervision, we introduce an adaptive submodular maximization-based policy designed for efficient human supervision allocation within multi-robot systems under uncertain connectivity. Our approach significantly reduces data redundancy by balancing the informativeness and diversity of data collection, and is capable of accommodating connectivity variances. We evaluated the effectiveness of ASA in a simulation environment with 100 robots across four different environments and various network settings, including a real-world teleoperation scenario over a 5G network. We trained and tested both our and the state-of-the-art policies utilizing NVIDIA's Isaac Gym, and our results show that ASA enhances the return on human effort by up to $5.95\times$, outperforming current baselines in all simulated scenarios and providing robustness against connectivity disruptions.</td>

Instead, model-based approaches that incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on the real robot.
Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus on ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is competitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods in final performance while maintaining safer behavior during training.</td>

run in real-time during operation. We demonstrate the superior performance of
Splat-MOVER in hardware experiments on a Kinova robot compared to two recent

We introduce a local optimistic strategy to efficiently and safely optimize the objective function, providing a probabilistic safety guarantee and a cumulative safety violation bound. Through the use of isometric embedding, HdSafeBO addresses problems ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dimensions while maintaining safety guarantees. To our knowledge, HdSafeBO is the first algorithm capable of optimizing the control of high-dimensional musculoskeletal systems with high safety probability.

RAM first extracts unified affordance at scale from diverse sources of demonstrations including robotic data, human-object interaction (HOI) data, and custom data to construct a comprehensive affordance memory. Then given a language instruction, RAM hierarchically retrieves the most similar demonstration from the affordance memory and transfers such out-of-domain 2D affordance to in-domain 3D actionable affordance in a zero-shot and embodiment-agnostic manner. Extensive simulation and real-world evaluations demonstrate that our RAM consistently outperforms existing works in diverse daily tasks.

In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework that holistically addresses these hurdles. Given a Boolean composition of multiple state constraints defining the safe set, our approach begins by constructing a smooth function whose zero superlevel set provides an inner approximation of the safe set. This function is then used with a smooth neural network to parameterize the CBF candidate. Finally, we design a physics-informed training loss function based on a Hamilton-Jacobi Partial Differential Equation (PDE) to train the PINN-CBF and enlarge the volume of the induced control invariant set.

However, autonomous improvement requires solving two key problems: (i) fully automating a scalable data collection procedure that can collect diverse and semantically meaningful robot data and (ii) learning from non-optimal, autonomous data with no human annotations. To this end, we propose a novel approach that addresses these challenges, allowing instruction following policies to improve from autonomously collected data without human supervision. Our framework leverages vision-language models to collect and evaluate semantically meaningful experiences in new environments, and then utilizes a decomposition of instruction following tasks into (semantic) language-conditioned image generation and (non-semantic) goal reaching, which makes it significantly more practical to improve from this autonomously collected data without any human annotations. We carry out extensive experiments in the real world to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and find that in a suite of unseen environments, the robot policy can be improved significantly with autonomously collected data.

Event cameras promise nearly zero motion blur and high dynamic range, but produce a very large volume of events under significant ego-motion and further lack a continuous-time sensor model in simulation, making direct sim-to-real transfer not possible. By leveraging depth prediction as an intermediate step in our learning framework, we can pre-train a reactive obstacle avoidance events-to-control policy in simulation, and then fine-tune the perception component with limited events-depth real-world data to achieve dodging in indoor and outdoor settings. We demonstrate this across two quadrotor-event camera platforms in multiple settings, and find, perhaps counter-intuitively, that low speeds (1m/s) make dodging harder and more prone to collisions, while high speeds (5m/s) result in better depth estimation and dodging.

                <td>Tactile sensing is critical to fine-grained, contact-rich manipulation tasks, such as insertion and assembly. Prior research has shown the possibility of learning tactile-guided policy from teleoperated demonstration data. However, to provide the demonstration, human users often rely on visual feedback to control the robot. This creates a gap between the sensing modality used for controlling the robot (visual) and the modality of interest (tactile). To bridge this gap, we introduce "MimicTouch'', a novel framework for learning policies directly from demonstrations provided by human users with their hands. The key innovations are i) a human tactile data collection system which collects multi-modal tactile dataset for learning human's tactile-guided control strategy, ii) an imitation learning-based framework for learning human's tactile-guided control strategy through such data, and iii) an online residual RL framework to bridge the embodiment gap between the human hand and the robot gripper. Through comprehensive experiments, we highlight the efficacy of utilizing human's tactile-guided control strategy to resolve contact-rich manipulation tasks.

To enhance the generalization capabilities of Diffusion Policy, we introduce a novel framework that incorporates explicit spatial and semantic information via 3D semantic fields. We generate 3D descriptor fields from multi-view RGBD observations with large foundational vision models, then compare these descriptor fields against reference descriptors and obtain semantic fields. The proposed method explicitly considers geometry and semantics, enabling strong generalization capabilities in tasks requiring category-level generalization, resolving geometric ambiguities, and attention to subtle geometric details. We evaluate our method across eight tasks involving articulated objects and instances with varying shapes and textures from multiple object categories. Our method demonstrates its effectiveness by increasing Diffusion Policy's average success rate on *unseen* instances from 20% to 93%. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis and visualization to interpret the sources of performance gain and explain how our method can generalize to novel instances.

                <td>It is desired to equip robots with the capability of interacting with various soft materials as they are ubiquitous in the real world. While physics simulations are one of the predominant methods for data collection and robot training, simulating soft materials presents considerable challenges. Specifically, it is significantly more costly than simulating rigid objects in terms of simulation speed and storage requirements. These limitations typically restrict the scope of studies on soft materials to small and bounded areas, thereby hindering the learning of skills in broader spaces. To address this issue, we introduce UBSoft, a new simulation platform designed to support unbounded soft environments for robot skill acquisition. Our platform utilizes spatially adaptive resolution scales, where simulation resolution dynamically adjusts based on proximity to active robotic agents. Our framework markedly reduces the demand for extensive storage space and computation costs required for large-scale scenarios involving soft materials. We also establish a set of benchmark tasks in our platform, including both locomotion and manipulation tasks, and conduct experiments to evaluate the efficacy of various reinforcement learning algorithms and trajectory optimization techniques, both gradient-based and sampling-based. Preliminary results indicate that sampling-based trajectory optimization generally achieves better results for obtaining one trajectory to solve the task. Additionally, we conduct experiments in real-world environments to demonstrate that advancements made in our UBSoft simulator could translate to improved robot interactions with large-scale soft material.

Learning from human demonstrations has proven highly effective for learning a dexterous manipulation policy. To collect such data, teleoperation serves as a straightforward and efficient way to do so.
However, a cost-effective and easy-to-use teleoperation system is lacking for anthropomorphic robot hands.
To fill the deficiency, we developed \our, a cross-platform visual-exoskeleton system for low-cost dexterous teleoperation. 
Our system employs a hand-facing camera to capture 3D hand poses and an exoskeleton mounted on a base that can be easily carried on users' backs. ACE captures both the hand root end-effector and hand pose in real-time and enables cross-platform operations. 
We evaluate the key system parameters compared with previous teleoperation systems and show clear advantages of \our.
We then showcase the desktop and mobile versions of our system on six different robot platforms (including humanoid-hands, arm-hands, arm-gripper, and quadruped-gripper systems), and demonstrate the effectiveness of learning three difficult real-world tasks through the collected demonstration on two of them.</td>

                <td>Training robot policies in the real world can be unsafe, costly, and difficult to scale. Simulation serves as an inexpensive and potentially limitless source of training data, but suffers from the semantics and physics disparity between simulated and real-world environments. These discrepancies can be minimized by training in *digital twins*, which serve as virtual replicas of a real scene but are expensive to generate and cannot produce cross-domain generalization. To address these limitations, we propose the concept of *digital cousins*, a virtual asset or scene that, unlike a *digital twin*, does not explicitly model a real-world counterpart but still exhibits similar geometric and semantic affordances. As a result, *digital cousins* simultaneously reduce the cost of generating an analogous virtual environment while also facilitating better generalization across domains by providing a distribution of similar training scenes. Leveraging digital cousins, we introduce a novel method for the **A**utomatic **C**reation of **D**igital **C**ousins (**ACDC**), and propose a fully automated real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for generating fully interactive scenes and training robot policies that can be deployed zero-shot in the original scene. We find that **ACDC** can produce digital cousin scenes that preserve geometric and semantic affordances, and can be used to train policies that outperform policies trained on digital twins, achieving 90\% vs. 25\% under zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Yet, a real-world active stereo or ToF depth camera often produces noisy and incomplete depth which bottlenecks robot performances. In this work, we propose D3RoMa, a learning-based depth estimation framework on stereo image pairs that predicts clean and accurate depth in diverse indoor scenes, even in the most challenging scenarios with translucent or specular surfaces where classical depth sensing completely fails. Key to our method is that we unify depth estimation and restoration into an image-to-image translation problem by predicting the disparity map with a denoising diffusion probabilistic model.  At inference time, we further incorporated a left-right consistency constraint as classifier guidance to the diffusion process. Our framework combines recently advanced learning-based approaches and geometric constraints from traditional stereo vision. For model training, we create a large scene-level synthetic dataset with diverse transparent and specular objects to compensate for existing tabletop datasets. The trained model can be directly applied to real-world in-the-wild scenes and achieve state-of-the-art performance in multiple public depth estimation benchmarks. Further experiments in both simulated and real environments show that accurate depth prediction significantly improves robotic manipulation in various scenarios.</td>

We propose a novel and effective active learning (AL) method called Distribution Discrepancy and Feature Heterogeneity (DDFH), which simultaneously considers geometric features and model embeddings, assessing information from both the instance-level and frame-level perspectives. Distribution Discrepancy evaluates the difference and novelty of instances within the unlabeled and labeled distributions, enabling the model to learn efficiently with limited data. Feature Heterogeneity ensures the heterogeneity of intra-frame instance features, maintaining feature diversity while avoiding redundant or similar instances, thus minimizing annotation costs. Finally, multiple indicators are efficiently aggregated using Quantile Transform, providing a unified measure of informativeness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDFH outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the KITTI and Waymo datasets, effectively reducing the bounding box annotation cost by 56.3% and showing robustness when working with both one-stage and two-stage models.</td>

However, the data that such policies are trained on is generally of mixed quality -- not only are human-collected demonstrations unlikely to perform the task perfectly, but the larger the dataset is, the harder it is to curate only the highest quality examples. It also remains unclear how optimal data from one embodiment is for training on another embodiment. In this paper, we present a general and broadly applicable approach that enhances the performance of such generalist robot policies by re-ranking their actions according to a value function learned via offline RL. This approach, which we call Value-Guided Policy Steering (V-GPS), is compatible with a wide range of different generalist policies, without needing to fine-tune or even access the weights of the policy. We show that the same value function can improve the performance of four different state-of-the-art policies with different architectures, even though they were trained on distinct datasets, attaining consistent performance improvement on multiple robotic platforms across a total of 14 tasks.

To automatically generate demonstration data for these tasks at scale, we propose planning and RL solvers that generalize within object categories. The pipeline can generate data for up to 100 articulated tasks with 200 objects and reduce the required human efforts. To utilize such data, we propose an effective multi-task language-conditioned policy architecture, dubbed proprioceptive point-cloud transformer (PPT), that learns from the generated demonstrations and exhibits strong sim-to-real zero-shot transfer. Combining the proposed pipeline and the policy architecture, we show a promising usage of GenSim2 that the generated data can be used for zero-shot transfer or co-train with real-world collected data, which enhances the policy performance by 20% compared with training exclusively on limited real data.</td>

                <td>To train generalist robot policies, machine learning methods often require an abundance of expert human data.  A natural robot for humans to teleoperate is one that mimics themselves: bimanual arms and dexterous hands.   However, building a bimanual teleoperation system for over 50DOF that accurately tracks both arms and hands is an extremely difficult problem.  To address this, we introduce BiDex, an extremely dexterous, low-cost, low-latency and portable bimanual dexterous teleoperation system which relies on motion capture gloves and lightweight teacher arms.  Our system is easy to use and can complete a variety of dexterous tasks in a natural intuitive manner, and enables collecting data training policies using imitation.  We compare to two baseline approaches for data collection, using the Vision Pro teleoperation system and the SteamVR system. We also show BiDex operating a mobile bimanual robot for in the wild tasks. Please refer to https://bidex-teleop.github.io for more video results.</td>

Bi-manual robot piano playing constitutes a task that combines challenges from dynamic tasks, such as generating fast while precise motions, with slower but contact-rich manipulation problems. Although reinforcement learning based approaches have shown promising results in single-task performance, these methods struggle in a multi-song setting. Our work aims to close this gap and, thereby, enable imitation learning approaches for robot piano playing at scale. To this end, we introduce the Robot Piano 1 Million (RP1M) dataset, containing bi-manual robot piano playing motion data of more than one million trajectories. We formulate finger placements as an optimal transport problem, thus, enabling automatic annotation of vast amounts of unlabeled songs. Benchmarking existing imitation learning approaches shows that such approaches reach state-of-the-art robot piano playing performance by leveraging RP1M.</td>

In contrast, point clouds naturally represent this geometry and easily integrate color and positional data from multiple camera views. However, while point-cloud processing with deep learning has seen many recent successes, RL on point clouds is under-researched, with only the simplest encoder architecture considered in the literature. We introduce PointPatchRL (PPRL), a method for RL on point clouds that builds on the common paradigm of dividing point clouds into overlapping patches, tokenizing them, and processing
the tokens with transformers. PPRL provides significant improvements compared with other point-cloud processing architectures previously used for RL. We then complement PPRL with masked reconstruction for representation learning and show that our method outperforms strong model-free and model-based baselines on image observations in complex manipulation tasks containing deformable objects and variations in target object geometry.</td>

The interface between these two policies are end-effector trajectories in the task-frame, which are inferred by the manipulation policy and passed to the whole-body controller for tracking. We evaluate UMI-on-Legs on prehensile, non-prehensile, and dynamic manipulation tasks, and report over 70% success rate for all tasks. Lastly, we also demonstrate the zero-shot cross-embodiment deployment of a pre-trained manipulation policy checkpoint from a prior work, originally intended for a fixed-base robot arm, on our quadruped system.

Existing methods focus on optimizing adversariality while preserving the naturalness of scenarios, aiming to achieve a balance through data-driven approaches. However, without an appropriate upper bound for adversariality, the scenarios might exhibit excessive adversariality, potentially leading to unavoidable collisions. In this paper, we introduce FREA, a novel safety-critical scenarios generation method that incorporates the Largest Feasible Region (LFR) of AV as guidance to ensure the reasonableness of the adversarial scenarios. Concretely, FREA initially pre-calculates the LFR of AV from offline datasets. Subsequently, it learns a reasonable adversarial policy that controls critical background vehicles (CBVs) in the scene to generate adversarial yet AV-feasible scenarios by maximizing a novel feasibility-dependent objective function. Extensive experiments illustrate that FREA can effectively generate safety-critical scenarios, yielding considerable near-miss events while ensuring AV's feasibility. Generalization analysis also confirms the robustness of FREA in AV testing across various surrogate AV methods and traffic environments.</td>

Multi-modality occurs when the method to open a fully closed door (push, pull, slide) is uncertain, or the side from which it should be opened is uncertain.  Occlusions further obscure the door’s shape from certain angles, creating further ambiguities during the occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we propose a history-aware diffusion network that models the multi-modal distribution of the articulated object and uses history to disambiguate actions and make stable predictions under occlusions.

First, LaNE builds on the pre-trained DINOv2 feature extractor to learn an embedding space for forward prediction. Next, it rewards the agent for exploring near the demos, quantified by quadratic control costs in the embedding space. Finally, LaNE optimizes the policy for the augmented rewards with RL.

We propose a novel approach to construct compact and interpretable reward models from automatically selected state features. These inferred rewards have an explicit form and enable the learning of policies that closely match expert behavior by training standard reinforcement learning algorithms from scratch.

We propose Manipulate-Anything, a scalable automated generation method for real-world robotic manipulation.
Unlike prior work, our method can operate in real-world environments without any privileged state information, hand-designed skills, and can manipulate any static object.

Second, Manipulate-Anything's demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations, or from data generated by VoxPoser and Code-As-Policies.

We propose Robot See Robot Do (RSRD), a method for visual imitation of articulated object manipulation from human demonstrations given only a multi-view object scan and a single RGB demonstration video. We represent the object as a part-centric neural feature field, then jointly track these parts in 3D via analysis-by-synthesis. After observing the demonstration, RSRD can replicate object trajectories by planning bimanual arm motions that induce object motion that matches the tracked 3D trajectory. By representing demonstrations as part-centric trajectories, RSRD can focus on replicating the demonstration's intended behavior while considering the robot's own morphological limits, rather than focus on imitating the human hand. We evaluate RSRD's 3D tracking accuracy on ground truth annotated 3D part trajectories and physical execution performance on five objects across 5 trials each. For robot evaluation, we use a bimanual YuMi robot to report success rates for each of 4 phases in the RSRD imitation pipeline, with each object in 5 random configurations within the robot's workspace: 92% for initialization, 96% for planning, 77% for initial grasps, and 82% for motion execution, resulting in successful imitation for 56% of initial object configurations. Notably, this is accomplished using only feature fields distilled from large pretrained vision models — without any task-specific training, fine-tuning, dataset collection, or annotation.</td>

Self-play in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to develop competitive strategies. However, the complexity arising from multi-agent interactions and the tendency for RL agents to disrupt competitors' training introduce instability and a risk of overfitting. While traditional methods depend on costly Nash equilibrium approximations or random exploration for training scenario optimization, this can be inefficient in large search spaces often prevalent in multi-agent problems. However, related works in single-agent setups show that genetic algorithms perform better in large scenario spaces. Therefore, we propose using genetic algorithms to adaptively adjust environment parameters and opponent policies in a multi-agent context to find and synthesize coherent scenarios efficiently. We also introduce GenOpt Agent—a genetically optimized, open-loop agent executing scheduled actions. The open-loop aspect of GenOpt prevents RL agents from winning through adversarial perturbations, thereby fostering generalizable strategies. Also, GenOpt is genetically optimized without expert supervision, negating the need for expensive expert supervision to have meaningful opponents at the start of training. Our empirical studies indicate that this method surpasses several established baselines in two-player competitive settings with continuous action spaces, validating its effectiveness and stability in training.</td>

While numerous large datasets facilitate learning *generative* models for multi-finger grasping at scale, reliable real-world dexterous grasping remains challenging, with most methods degrading when deployed on hardware. An alternate strategy is to use *discriminative* grasp evaluation models for grasp selection and refinement, conditioned on real-world sensor measurements. This paradigm has produced state-of-the-art results for vision-based parallel-jaw grasping, but remains unproven in the multi-finger setting. In this work, we find that existing datasets and methods have been insufficient for training discriminitive models for multi-finger grasping. To train grasp evaluators at scale, datasets must provide on the order of millions of grasps, including both positive *and negative examples*, with corresponding visual data resembling measurements at inference time. To that end, we release a new, open-source dataset of 3.5M grasps on 4.3K objects annotated with RGB images, point clouds, and trained NeRFs. Leveraging this dataset, we train vision-based grasp evaluators that outperform both analytic and generative modeling-based baselines on extensive simulated and real-world trials across a diverse range of objects. We show via numerous ablations that the key factor for performance is indeed the evaluator, and that its quality degrades as the dataset shrinks, demonstrating the importance of our new dataset.

Additionally, We open source PAWS-Sim, a high-speed photo-realistic simulator which integrates PAWS-Data with IsaacSim, enabling research for visuomotor policy learning. We evaluate the utility of the affordance model on a quadrupedal robot, which plans through affordances to follow pathways and sidewalks, and avoid human collisions.

                <td>While deep neural networks (DNN) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) have both been commonly used in autonomous driving to predict trajectories from expert demonstrations, DNN-based methods suffer from data-scarcity, and IRL-based approaches struggle with locality and limited robustness, making both hard to apply to new driving scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce **EscIRL**, a novel decoupled bi-level training framework that iteratively learns robust reward functions from complex multi-scenario expert demonstrations. On the inner level, **EscIRL** introduces a self-contrastive IRL module to learn the reward from contrasted expert demonstrations. And on the outer level, **EscIRL**  employs an evolving loop that iteratively refines the contrastive sets to ensure convergence. Experiments on two multi-scenario datasets, CitySim and INTERACTION, demonstrate the advancements of **EscIRL**, outperforming state-of-the-art DNN and IRL-based methods by 82.5\% and 58.7\% on average. Notably, we illustrate that **EscIRL** achieves better generalizability than the competitive DNN-based approaches, which are known to have better generalizability, 
while only requiring a fraction of the data, making it not prone to any data-scarcity constraint.</td>

                <td>Enabling autonomous vehicles to reliably operate at the limits of handling— where tire forces are saturated — would improve their safety, particularly in scenarios like emergency obstacle avoidance or adverse weather conditions.
However, unlocking this capability is challenging due to the task's dynamic nature and the high sensitivity to uncertain multimodal properties of the road, vehicle, and their dynamic interactions.
Motivated by these challenges, we propose a framework to learn a conditional diffusion model for high-performance vehicle control using an unlabelled multimodal trajectory dataset.
We design the diffusion model to capture the distribution of parameters of a physics-informed data-driven dynamics model.
By conditioning the generation process on online measurements, we integrate the diffusion model into a real-time model predictive control framework for driving at the limits, and show that it can adapt on the fly to a given vehicle and environment.
Extensive experiments on a Toyota Supra and a Lexus LC 500 show that a single diffusion model enables reliable autonomous drifting on both vehicles when operating with different tires in varying road conditions.
The model matches the performance of task-specific expert models while outperforming them in generalization to unseen conditions, paving the way towards a general, reliable method for autonomous driving at the limits of handling.</td>

                <td>Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide safety guarantees for multi-agent navigation. However, traditional approaches require full knowledge of the environment (e.g., obstacle positions and shapes) to formulate CBFs and hence, are not applicable in unknown environments. This paper overcomes this issue by proposing an Online Exploration-based Control Lyapunov Barrier Function (OE-CLBF) controller. It estimates the unknown environment by learning its corresponding CBF with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) in an online manner, using local neighborhood information, and leverages the latter to generate actions for safe navigation. To reduce the computation incurred by the online SVM training, we use an Imitation Learning (IL) framework to predict the importance of neighboring agents with Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and train the SVM only with information received from neighbors of high `value'. The OE-CLBF allows for decentralized deployment, and importantly, provides provable safety guarantees that we derive in this paper. Experiments corroborate theoretical findings and demonstrate superior performance w.r.t. state-of-the-art baselines in a variety of unknown environments.</td>
